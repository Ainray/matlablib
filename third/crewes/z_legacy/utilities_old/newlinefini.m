function lineinfo=newlinefini
%
% lineinfo=newlinefini
% 
% NEWLINEFINI is called to obtain the handle and (x,y)'s of a line created
% by NEWLINE and to perform needed cleanup. The returned information
% consists of a cell array of the handle of the new line, a vector of x coordinates and a
% vector of y coordinates. 
%
% lineinfo={key handle x y}
%
% The key gives needed information about the new line as follows:
% key = 1 ... the line was created by drawing with the mouse
% key = 2 ... the line was created by duplicating an existing line
% key = 3 ... the line was created by undoing a line deletion
% key = 4 ... the line was actually deleted. Its handle is no longer valid.
%
% When a line is deleted, the lineinfo return value has all of the above
% information plus additionaly info encoding the deleted lines color,
% linestyle, etc. This is appended to the above information using a NaN as
% a flag. Thus if key==4, then :
%   ind=find(isnan(lineinfo));
%	info = lineinfo(1:ind-1);
% will store in info the simple lineinformation vector given above. The
% simplest way to restore a deleted line with its color etc intact is to call:
% newline('undo',lineinfo,transfer);
% where lineinfo is the complete return value from NEWLINEFINI and transfer
% is a string indicatining where the NEWLINE should return to when completed
% (see NEWLINEINIT)
