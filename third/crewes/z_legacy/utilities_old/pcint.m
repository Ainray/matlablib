function yi=pcint(x,y,xi)
% yi=pcint(x,y,xi)
%
% pcint does piecewise constant interpolation.
% That is, x and y are assumed to represent a function that is
% "blocky" or piecewise constant. This means that for any xi
% between x(k) and x(k+1), the function evaluates to y(k).
% Points with xi < x(1) evaluate to y(1) and for xi>x(length(x))
% evaluate to y(length(x))
% NOTE xi must be sorted in ascending order. (xi(k)<xi(k+1))
