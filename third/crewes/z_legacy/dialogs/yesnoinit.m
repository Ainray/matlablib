function yesnoinit(transfer,q)
% yesnoinit(transfer,q)
%
% YESNOINIT initiates a dialog which allows the user to answer a single yes/no
% question. Three responses are possible (see YESNOFINI): yes, no, or cancel
%    transfer = a string matlab command to be evaluated with EVAL at the 
%               completion of the dialog. Usually this will re-invoke 
%               the calling program
%    q = question to appear at the top of the dialog. Usually this will be 
%         something like 'Save the Universe first?'
