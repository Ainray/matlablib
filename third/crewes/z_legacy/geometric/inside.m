function result=inside(xpt,ypt,xpoly,ypoly)
% result = inside(xpt,ypt,xpoly,ypoly)
%
% function returns 1 if (xpt,ypt) is inside the polygon described by
% xpoly and ypoly and 0 otherwise
%
%  xpt = x coordinates of the test points. May be a scalar, vector or matrix.
%  ypt = y coordinates of the test pts
%  xpoly = vector of the x coordinates of the polygon vertices
%          The last vertex is tested against the first and is discarded
%          if it is identical
% ypoly =  vector of the y coordinates of the polygon vertices
%
% result =  vector of boolean values the same size as xpt(:). Points inside
%           the polygon may be addressed as xpt(result) and ypt(result) while
%           those outside are xpt(~result) and ypt(~result)
