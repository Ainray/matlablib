function [mask,htrin]=hmask(trin,thresh,flag)

% [mask,htrin]=hmask(trin,thresh,flag)
% [mask,htrin]=hmask(trin)
%
% Compute the Hilbert Reflectivity Mask of trin.
% HMASK returns a trace which is zero everywhere except at the samples
% corresponding to peaks of abs(hilbert(trin)) or peaks or abs(trin) where
% it is 1.0
%
% trin= input trace
% mask= output hilbert mask trace
% htrin= complex hilbert transform of trin. (e.g. hilbert(trin))
% thresh = threshold significance for peaks. Peaks on the Hilbert
%	envelope are ignored if they are smaller than thresh times
%	the maximum peak.
%	********** default = .05 *********
% flag = 0 .... pick peaks of the hilbert envelope=abs(hilbert(trin))
%      = 1 .... pick peaks of abs(trin)
% *********** default =0 ***************
