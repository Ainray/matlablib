function v=invgardner(rho,a,m)
% INVGARDNER - deduce velocity from density given Gardner parameters
% 
% v=invgardner(rho,a,m)
%
% INVGARDNER estimates a velocity vector given a density vector
% and values for the empirical parameters a and m as defined the Gardner relation
%	rho=a*v.^m (a times v to the mth power)
% Thus v = (rho/a).^(1/m)
%
% 	rho= density vector
%	a= scalar multplier
%		*********** default is .31 **********
%	m= scalar exponent
%		*********** default is .25 **********
%	v= a vector of velocities computed from v = (rho/a).^(1/m)
