function [x,y,z]=tvd_minc(zmd,azmi,incl)
% [x,y,z]=tvd_minc(zmd,azmi,incl)
%
% TVD_MINC uses the minimum curvature method to compute true 3-D coordinates
% of a wellbore path given information from a deviation survey. The method is
% documented in 'Directional Survey Calculation', by J.T. Craig and B.V. Randal
% found in 'Petroleum Engineer',March, 1976.
%
% zmd ... vector of measured depths
% azmi ... vector of azimuth angles in degrees
% incl ... vector of inclination angles in degrees
