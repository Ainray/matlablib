function S= fromdb(Sdb,refamp)
% S = fromdb(Sdb,refamp);
% S = fromdb(Sdb);
%
% FROMDB converts a complex spectrum from (decibels,phase angle) to 
% (real,imaginary). Thus if Sdb is a complex spectrum created by
% TODB, then the original complex spectrum can be recreated
% by fromdb(Sdb,refamp) if refamp is known or, to within a scale
% factor if refamp is not known.
%
% Sdb= input complex spectrum in (dbdown, phase angle) format
% refamp = input reference amplitude
%           decibels are dbdown from this value. If defaulted,
%           refamp= 1.0
% S= output complex spectrum in the (real, imaginary) format
%     
% 
% the INVERSE of this process is the function TODB found in
% the seismic toolbox
