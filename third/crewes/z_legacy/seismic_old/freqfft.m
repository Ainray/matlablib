function f=freqfft(t,n,flag) 
 
% f=freqfft(t,n,flag) 
% f=freqfft(t,[],flag)
% f=freqfft(t);
%
% returns the appropriate frequency coordinate vector for a 
% time series, s, whose spectrum, S, was calculated with
% S= fftshift(fft(s,n)) (sort of, see flag parameter)
%
% t= input time coordinate vector corresponding to s
% n= padded length of fft 
% ******** default n=length(t) ***********
% flag ... if 0, the f vector is returned unwrapped (f=0 in center, values between -Nyq and Nyq)
%          if 1, the f vector is returned wrapped (f=0 is first sample, , values between -Nyq and Nyq)
%          if 2, the f vector is returned wrapped (f=0 is first sample, , values between 0 and 2*Nyq)
%   ******* default 0 *******
% f= output frequency vector
