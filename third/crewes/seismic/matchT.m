% MATCHT: A least-squares, smoothness and time constrained, matching filter, good for wavelet estimation. 
%
% [mfilt,tm]=matchT(trin,trdsign,t,mlength,icausal,mu)
%
% MATCHT designs a match filter of specified temporal length which matches trin to trdsign in
% the least squares sense and is constrained to be smooth and time localized. The smoothness
% constraint is imposed by requiring the second derivative of the filter (the model) to be
% small at the same time as we minimize the error of the data fit. The time constraint is that
% wavelet samples far from time zero are penalized. This is done by applying a window=1-g,where
% g is a Gaussian window centered at time zero, to the solution and requiring that the windowed
% answer be small at the same time as the other two terms.  Thus the total objective function
% is A+mu(1)*B+mu(2)*C where A is the sum-squared error, B is the energy (sum of squares) of
% the second derivative, and C is the energy of the windows signal. The objective function is
% minimized and mu(1) and mu(2) provide the weights for the two constraints. The mus values
% should be non-negative. The filter can be causal or non causal. See Constable et al, 1987,
% Geophysics, "Occams's inversion: a practical algorithm for generating smooth models from
% electromagnetic sounding data".
%
% Details on the time constraint: let g be a gaussian window centered at time zero and of the
% same length as the match filter. The standard deviation, sigma, of the gaussian is set such
% that it is 2*sigma down at the ends of the match filter. Thus if the match filter is time
% symmetric (i.e. t=0 is in the middle) then g is symmetric, otherwise, g is not. Then, the
% window W=1-g, when applied to the match filter, emphasizes those samples near the ends while
% the samples near t=0 get nearly zero weight. Thus requiring that W.*mfilt be small forces
% most of the filter energy to be within +/- one sigma of the origin. This works well if the
% misalignment between trin and trdsign is small but otherwise can be erroneous. The choise of
% a gaussian window and 2 sigma down at the ends is arbitrary. Ths can be changed by modifying
% the internal function designtimeweights at the end of this file.
%
% trin= input trace to be matched to trdsign
% trdsign= input trace which is to be matched
% t= time coordinate vector for trin
% ***** note: trin and trdsign must be the same length
% mlength= length of the match filter in seconds
% icausal=0 ... a fully noncausal operator is desired. (t=0 is in the middle)
%     =1 ... a causal operator is desired (t=0 is the first sample).
%     =N ... where N>1 means that the operator will have N-1 samples in negative time. This
%     allows a continuum of variation between symmetric and causal. (t=0 will be sample N).
% NOTE: icausal=0 is the same as icausal=nsamp/2+1 where nsamp is the closest odd number of samples
%   to the requested filter length. This control is about how many samples before a
%   given time and after that time are needed to predict trdesign. Fully causal operators, even
%   if the wavelet is known to be causal, are generally not as good as those where icausal is
%   slightly greater than 1 (say 2 through 10).
% mu ... tradeoff parameters controlling the tradeoff between filter (model)
%       smoothness and time constraint and data fitting. Should be two nonnegative numberw. The
%       first is the smoothness weight and the second is the time constraint weight. Larger
%       values give stronger constraints while [0 0] gives the best fit to the data with no constraints.
