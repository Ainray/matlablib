%FKFANFILTER3Dtv ... time-variant 3D f-k fan filter
%
% seisf=fkfanfilter3Dtv(seis,t,x,y,va1,va2,dv,tpad,xpad,ypad)
%
% This function breaks a 3D seismic dataset into overlapping temporal windows and applies
% fkfanfilter3D to each window with window-dependent parameters. Any number of windows can be
% specified and the window size and overlap are user prescribed. FKFANFILTER3D designs and applies
% an f-k (frequency-wavenumber) fan reject filter in 3D. The reject region is fan-shaped (when
% viewed in frequency and radial wavenumber) and defined by two bounding apparent velocities, va1
% and va2. These are expressed as positive numbers and the filter is rotationally invariant about
% the vertical (t) axis. A raised cosine taper is applied to the filter edge. The filter is applied
% to each frequency as a radially symmetric multiplier (or mask) whose values lie between 0 and 1.
% This mask can be examined by returning all four values and then plotting it.
%
%
% seis ... 3D seismic matrix to be filtered. The first dimension is time, the second x and the third
%       y. All three coordinates must be regularly sampled.
% t ... time coordinate vector for seis. The length(t) must equal size(seis,1)
% x ... first space coordinate vector for seis. The length(x) must equal size(seis,2)
% y ... second space coordinate vector for seis. The length(y) must equal size(seis,3)
% twins ... vector of window boundary times. Do not include t(1) and t(end) as they are automatic.
%       The first window extends from t(1) to twins(1), the second from twins(1) to twins(2), and so
%       on until the last which is twins(end) to t(end). May be specified as [] for a single window
%       but in that case you should just use fkfanfilter3D directly.
% toverlap ... vector of window overlap times for each window. May be a single value if all windows
%       are to have the same overlap. This means that window 1 actually extends from t(1) to
%       twins(1)+toverlap(1) where the last toverlap(1) samples are multiplied by a raised cosine
%       taper. Similarly window 2 extends from twins(1)-toverlap(1) to twins(2)+toverlap(2) (with
%       tapering) and so on.
% va1 ... vector of minumum apparent velocities defining the rejection fan in each window. Enter 0 to
%       reject everything slower than va2. The length of va1 must be 1 greater than the
%       length(twins).
% va2 ... vector of maximum apparent velocities defining the rejection fan in each window. The
%       length(va2) must equal length(twins)+1.
% Requirement: va2>va1. Neither value can be negative.
%
% dv  ... vector of widths of the taper on the edge of the rejection fan in velocity
%         units (for each window).
%
% REQUIREMENT: 0<dv<va1<=va2.  Setting va1=va2 gives a very narrow reject region. Better rejection
% of a specific velocity, vn, follows from making va1 slightly less than vn and va2 slightly
% greater.
%
% tpad ... size (in t units) of temporal zero pad to be afixed to each windowed seismic section in
%           the first dimension.
% ********* default = 0.1*size_of_window **********
% xpad ... size (in x units) of spatial zero pad to be afixed to seis in the second dimension.
% ********* default = 0.1*(max(x)-min(x))***********
% ypad ... size (in y units) of spatial zero pad to be afixed to seis in the third dimension.
% ********* default = 0.1*(max(x)-min(x))***********
%
% NOTE: The values supplied for xpad, ypad, and tpad are minimal pads because, after afixing these pads,
% the matrix is further extended to the next power of 2 in all dimensions. The purpose of this pad
% is to minimize wraparound of the filter impulse response.
%
% seisf ... the f-k filtered result with all pads removed. It will be the same size as seis.
