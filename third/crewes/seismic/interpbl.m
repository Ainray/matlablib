function sint=interpbl(t,s,tint,n,m)
%INTERPBL ... bandlimited sinc function interpolation
%
% sint=interpbl2(t,s,tint,n,m)
%
% The sampling theorem gives the reconstruction formula to recover the
% continuous signal from its samples provided that the continuous signal is
% bandlimited (i.e. has compact support in the frequency domain). This
% formula is sint(k)=sum(sinc.*s) where sinc is a properly positioned sinc
% function (it must be shifted to have its maximum at the time of the
% interpoolated sample), s are the samples, and sint is the interpolated
% value. The sum is theoretically over an infinite set of samples and the
% sample weights from from the sinc function. To make this practical, the
% sinc function must be truncated so that the sum becomes finite. The sinc
% should also be smoothly tapered. Here, the half-length of the sinc
% function is specified by the input argument 'n' meaning the sinc extends
% for n points on either side of the maximum. So, if n=4, we say we are
% doing an 8 point interpolation. The truncated sinc is also windowed by a
% Gaussian whose standard deviation is n/2 so that the Gaussian is two
% standard deviations down at the truncation points.
%
% t ... vector of times of the input samples. t must be regularly spaced.
% s ... input samples from the bandlimited signal(s). This can be one trace
%       or a gather of traces. If the latter, then the interpolation sites
%       must be the same on all traces in the gather.
% *** the length of t must match one dimension of s. Preferably the row
% *** dimensions of both are the same.
% tint ... vector of times at which the interpolated values are desired
%       (the interpolation sites). tint does not need to be regular
%       although it can be.
% n ... half-length of the sinc function. n=4 gives similar performance to
%       a spline while n=8 is better.
%   ************ default n=8 *********
% m ... Gaussian window will be m styandard deviations down at the sinc
%       truncation point
%   ************ default m=2 *********
%
% sint ... output array of interpolated samples. There will be one column
% per input trace and the number of rows will match the length of tint.
