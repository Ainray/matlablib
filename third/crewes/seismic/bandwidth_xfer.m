function s2p=bandwidth_xfer(s1,s2,n)
% BANDWIDTH_XFER ... transfer the bandwidth of s1 to s2
%
% s2p=bandwidth_xfer(s1,s2,n)
%
% Transfer the amplitude spectrum of s1 to s2 in a smooth way. Let A1 and
% A2 be the smoothed amplitude spectra of s1 and s2. Then the the complex
% spectrum of s2P is S2p=S2.*A1./A2, where S2 is the complex spectrum of
% S2.
%
% s1 ... first input signal
% s2 ... second input signal (must be the same length as s1). s2 can be a
%       matrix in which case each column is shaped to the spectrum of s1.
% n ... number of samples in convolutional smoother to be applied to the
%       amplitude spectra of s1 and s2.
% ********* default is 10% of the length of the spectra ************
% s2p ... the new s2 with the amplitude spectrum of s1.
