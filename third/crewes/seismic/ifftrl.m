function [r,t]= ifftrl(spec,f)
% IFFTRL inverse Fourier transform for real time series
%
% [r,t]= ifftrl(spec,f)
%
% Inverse fourier transform to a real trace. The spectrum is
% assumed to be of length floor(n/2+1) where n is the length of the time
% series to be created. (This is automatically the case if it was created by
% fftrl). This is a slightly ambiguous situation since, for
% example, time series of length 4 and length 5 will both result in 3
% frequency samples. However, only the first case will have a sample at
% Nyquist. Since the sample at Nyquist should be purely real, the algorithm
% tests the sample spec(end) for a nonzero imaginary part. If a zero
% imaginary part is found, it is assumed to be a sample at Nyquist. So, a
% problem could arise if the spectrum has been altered such that the
% Nyquist is no longer purely real. So, a good practice is to always force
% the time series to have an even number of samples (before fftrl) and then
% force the Nyquist sample to be purely real (before ifftrl).

% spec= input spectrum
% f= input frequency sample vector (or 2D matrix or 3D array)
% r= output trace
% t= output time vector
