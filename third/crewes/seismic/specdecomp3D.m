function [amp,tout]=specdecomp3D(s,t,twin,tinc,fout,tmin,tmax)
% specdecomp3D: This is a 3D version of specdecomp. 
%
% [amp,tout]=specdecomp3D(s,t,twin,tinc,fout,tmin,tmax)
% 
% This function calls the 2D spectral decomposition function, specdecomp, on each 2D slice defined
% by haveing the 3rd dimension constant. Because spectral decompotion increases the dimensionality
% by 1, for a 3D volume the result is 4D. This is potentially a very large output data volume. For
% this reason, the output frequencies are defined by an explicit list rather than start, end, and
% increment. Be cautious about requesting too many output frequencies as your computer may explode.
% See specdecomp for more discussion on the computation.
%
% s ... 3D seismic matrix, one trace per column. Dimension 1 is time, 2 is x, and 3 is y.
% t ... time coordinate for s
% NOTE: Length of t must equal size(s,1)
% twin ... width (seconds) of the Gaussian window (standard deviation)
% tinc ... temporal shift (seconds) between windows, this is the output time sample rate. If in
%       doubt, make this twice the input time sample rate.
% fout ... list of frequencies at which the output volumes are desired. Should be integer values.
% tmin ... minimum output time (seconds)
% ********** default = t(1) ***********
% tmax ... maximum output time (seconds)
% ********** default = t(end) ***********
%
% amp ... Cell array of 3D amplitude spectral decomp matrices, one for each entry in fout. 
% tout ... time coordinate for amp
