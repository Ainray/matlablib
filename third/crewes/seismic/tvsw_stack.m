function stackw=tvsw_stack(stack,t,tstart,aec_length,flow,fhigh,nfilt)
% TVSW_STACK: applies frequency domain decon to a stacked section
%
% stackd=tvsw_stack(stack,t,tstart,aec_length,flow,fhigh,nfilt)
%
% TVSW_STACK applies tvsw (time variant spectral whitening) to all traces in a
% stack. TVSW does time variant spectral whitening. A set of gaussian filters are
% designed to slice a frequency range in such a way that the linear sum of
% slices returns the original spectrum. Each slice is then ifft'd into the
% time domain and agc'd. Finally, the slices are summed in the time domain.
%
% stack ... stacked section as a matrix of traces. 
% t ... time coordinate for stack
% tstart ... start time. earlier times will be zero'd. This process works
%       best if the traces all have the same start time (defined as the
%       first live sample). Often a real stack will have a ragged start
%       time due to a mute. Choose a values such that all traces are live
%       at this time.
% aec_length ... length (seconds) of the aec operator (see aec.m, this is a
%       form of agc)
% flow ... lowest frequency to be whitened (Hz)
% fhigh ... highest frequency to be whitened (Hz)
% nfilt ... number of Gaussian filter slices
% NOTE: The Gaussians will be centered at the frequencies
%   f0=flow+(k-1)*fwidth where fwidth=(fhigh-flow)/(nfilt-1) and have
%   standard deviation of fwidth. This means that there will be some
%   whitening outside of flow->fhigh.
% 
% stackw ... whitened stack
