% WAVENUMBER_GAUSSMASK: apply a 2D Gaussian mask to the 2DFFT of a seismic timeslice or depthslice
%
% slicem=wavenumber_gaussmask(slice,x,y,sigmax,sigmay)
%
% It is often desirable to apply a filter that suppresses the higher wavenumbers on a seismic time
% or depth slice. This function does that by performing a 2D FFT on the slice and then pointwise
% multiplying the wavenumber spectrum by a Gaussian mask. The Gaussian mask has the same dimensions
% as the spectrum and is a either a decaying or growing Guassian in both kx and ky. Both masks are
% unity at the origin and decay (or grow) away from the origin. The total mask is the poitwise
% product of the kx and ky masks.
%
% slice ... input time slice, the column coordinate is x and the row coordinate is y.
% x ... coordinate for the columns of slice. The length(x) must equal size(slice,2). x should be
%       in physical units like feet or meters (i.e. not linenumber) so that wavenumbers are
%       calculated correctly. Must be regularly spaced for the FFT.
% y ... coordinate for the rows of slice. The length(y) must equal size(slice,1). y should be
%       in physical units like feet or meters (i.e. not linenumber) so that wavenumbers are
%       calculated correctly. Must be regularly spaced for the FFT.
% sigmax ... stdev of mask in kx expressed as a fraction of kxnyq. That is the actual stddev is
%               sigmax*kxnyq. Positive values give decay while negative values mean growth.
% sigmay ... similar for sigmax but in the ky direction
%
% slicem ... the wavenumber filtered slice
