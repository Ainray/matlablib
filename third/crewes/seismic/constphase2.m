function [phi,obj]=constphase2(s1,s2,flag)
% CONSTPHASE: find the best constant phase rotation to match one signal to another
%
% [phi,obj]=constphase2(s1,s2,flag)
%
% Given two signals s1 and s2, this function finds the constant phase rotation which, when applied
% to s1, minimizes the L2 norm of the difference: s2-phase_rotated(s1) . ("Constant phase" means the
% phase is the same for all frequencies.) This version does a direct search over integer phase
% angles.
%
% s1 ... input time series to be rotated
% s2 ... input time series to match to rotated s1
% flag ... 1 means impose the bandwidth of s1 on s2 before determining
%       rotation (see bandwidth_xfer)
%          0 means don't do that
% ************* default = 1 ***********
% phi ... best constant phase angle in degrees. To rotate s1 to look like
%           s2, use s1r=phsrot(s1,phi)
% obj ... the L2 norm of the difference for integer phase rotations from
%           -180 to 179. Phi comes from the minimum of this function.
% NOTE: You can plot obj with: plot(-180:179,obj);xlabel('Angle in degrees')
