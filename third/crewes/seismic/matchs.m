function [mfilt,tm]=matchs(trin,trdsign,t,mlength,icausal,mu)
% MATCHS: A least-squares, smoothness constrained, matching filter, good for wavelet estimation. 
%
% [mfilt,tm]=matchs(trin,trdsign,t,mlength,icausal,mu)
%
% MATCHS designs a match filter of specified temporal length
% which matches trin to trdsign in the least squares sense and is
% constrained to be smooth. The smoothness constraint is imposed by
% requiring the second derivative of the filter (the model) to be small at
% the same time as we minimize the error of the data fit. The filter can be
% causal or non causal. See Constable et al, 1987, Geophysics, "Occams's
% inversion: a practical algorithm for generating smooth models from
% electromagnetic sounding data".
%
% trin= input trace to be matched to trdsign
% trdsign= input trace which is to be matched
% t= time coordinate vector for trin
% ***** note: trin and trdsign must be the same length
% mlength= length of the match filter in seconds
% icausal=0 ... a fully noncausal operator is desired. (t=0 is in the middle)
%     =1 ... a causal operator is desired (t=0 is the first sample).
%     =N ... where N>1 means that the operator will have N-1 samples in negative time. This
%     allows a continuum of variation between symmetric and causal. (t=0 will be sample N).
% NOTE: icausal=0 is the same as icausal=nsamp/2+1 where nsamp is the closest odd number of samples
%   to the requested filter length. This control is about how many samples before a
%   given time and after that time are needed to predict trdesign. Fully causal operators, even
%   if the wavelet is known to be causal, are generally not as good as those where icausal is
%   slightly greater than 1 (say 2 through 10).
% mu ... tradeoff parameter controlling the tradeoff between filter (model)
%       smoothness and data fitting. Should be a nonnegative number. Larger
%       values give smoother filters while 0 gives the best fit to the data
%       with no smoothness.
