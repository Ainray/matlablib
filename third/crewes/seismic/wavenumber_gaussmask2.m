% WAVENUMBER_GAUSSMASK2: apply a 2D Gaussian mask to the 2DFFT of a seismic timeslice or depthslice
%
% [slicem,mask,kx,ky]=wavenumber_gaussmask2(slice,sigmax,sigmay,whiten,delkx,delky,stab,izero)
%
% This version is preferred over wavenumber_gaussmask. The difference being this version used fft2
% directly while wavenumber_gaussmask uses fktran which caused a slight asymmetry.
%
% It is often desirable to apply a filter that suppresses the higher wavenumbers on a seismic time
% or depth slice. This function does that by performing a 2D FFT on the slice and then pointwise
% multiplying the wavenumber spectrum by a Gaussian mask. The Gaussian mask has the same dimensions
% as the spectrum and is a either a decaying or growing Guassian in both kx and ky. Both masks are
% unity at the origin and decay (or grow) away from the origin. The total mask is the pointwise
% product of the kx and ky masks.
%
% An option exists now to whiten the spatial spectrum before applying the Gaussian mask. This is
% done in close analogy to temporal deconvolution meaning that the whitening process divides the
% data spectrum by its smoothed self. The smoothed self is really formed just from the data amplitude
% spectrum (no phase) which is convolved with a 2D boxcar of user spcified dimensions. A stability
% constant of stab*Amax (Amax is the maximum of the amplitude spectrum) is added to the data
% spectrum before smoothing. The returned mask is the combined effect (pointwise product) of the
% Gaussian mask and the whitening operator. The combined mask is normalized to have a maximum of 1.
%
% slice ... input time slice, the column coordinate is x and the row coordinate is y.
% sigmax ... stdev of mask in kx expressed as a fraction of kxnyq. That is the actual stddev is
%               sigmax*kxnyq. Positive values give decay while negative values mean growth.
% sigmay ... similar for sigmax but in the ky direction
% whiten ... 0, dont do spatial whitening, 1 means do it
% ********* default = 0 ***********
% delkx, delky, stab are only inportant for spatial whitening. nan also gets the default
% delkx ... width of boxcar smoother in kx, as a fraction of nyquist. Larger is smoother but also slower.
% ********* default = .05 ********
% delky ... width of boxcar smoother in ky, as a fraction of nyquist. Larger is smoother but also slower.
% ********* default = .05 ********
% stab ... small positive number expressing the amount of whiten noise added to the spectrum before
%           smoothing in the design of the inverse operator.
% ********* default =.1 *********
% izero ... 1 means rezero anything that was zero before the filter, 0 means don't
% ********* default = 1 *********************
%
% slicem ... the wavenumber filtered slice
% mask ... the applied Gaussian mask. Same size as fft(slicem);
% kx,ky ... waevnumber coordinates for plotting mask
