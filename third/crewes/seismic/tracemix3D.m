function seis=tracemix3D(seis,weights)
% TRACEMIX3D ... weighted trace mixing on a 3D seismic volume
%
% seis=tracemix3D(seis,weights)
%
% seis ... input seismic section. Should be a 3D matrix with one trace per
%           column, t is dimenstion 1, x is dimension 2 and y is dimension 3.
% weights ... 2D matrix of mixing weights. (Can be a 1D vector if the weights are the same in x and y).
%           Mixing is accomplished as a 2D convolution with the time slices. Therefore the major
%           computation loop is over dimension 1. Dimension 1 of weights corresponds to dimension 2
%           of seis and dimension 2 of weights is dimension 3 of seis. The input weights are
%           normalized by division by sum(abs(weights(:))).
%
% seis ... output seismic section
