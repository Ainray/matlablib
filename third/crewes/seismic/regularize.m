function [seis2,x2,y2,s2,s1]=regularize(seis,x,y)
% REGULARIZE ... regularize the trace spacing on a 2D seismic section
%
% [seis2,x2,y2,s2,s1]=regularize(seis,x,y)
%
% The input seismic section is assumed to be regular in t but irregular in terms of distance alone
% the trace. This method works best if the line is nearly regular in its trace spacing. That is if
% there is a dominant trace spacing that occurs most of the time with some variation. Repeated
% traces are no problem but large gaps are. Method: compute the Euclidean intertrace distances from
% the input (x,y). The output trace spacing will be the mode of the input spacing (that is the most
% frequently occuring spacing). Given this spacing, the output coordinate defines bin centers into
% which the input traces are stacked (and fold normalized). After this, any trace gaps are filled
% with the average of the first trace before and after the gap. This is a very simple method, it is
% not structurally aware. It works well on arbitrary lines from well-sampled 3D volumes.
%
% seis ... input seismic matrix x ... x trace coordinate for seis. 
% NOTE: length(x) must equal size(seis,2) 
% y ... y trace coordinate for seis 
% ********* default zeros(size(x)) *********** 
% NOTE: x and y can also be matrices. In this case, the first rows of each should be geographic
% coordinates from which Euclidean distance can be calculated. The remaining rows can be other types
% of coordinates like inline and crossline that correlate with x and y. These will then all be
% interpolated into corresponding X2 and Y2 on output.
% seis2 ... output seismic matrix 
% x2 ... x trace coordinate for seis2 
% y2 ... ytrace coordinate for seis2 
% s2 ... distance coordinate for seis2. Distance is calculated from the first trace.
% s1 ... distance coordinate for the input seis
% NOTE: length(x2) will always equal size(seis2,x) and the same with y2. Also
% sum(abs(diff(diff(s2)))) will always be zero. The latter means that s2 is regularly spaced.
% NOTE2: If the input line has constant y coordinate, then x2 will be regularly spaced. Similarly y2
% will be regular if x is constant. For both x and y changing, as is the case for an arbitrary line
% from a 3D volume, then only s2 will be regular on output. When plotting using Matlab's image
% command, the x axis is only correctly annotated if it is regular. This is true for CREWES display
% tools such as plotimage, seisplot, etc that use the image facility. Thus for arbitrary lines, it
% is best to use s2 for the trace coordinate.
