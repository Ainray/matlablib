% EXTRACT_WAVELETS_ROYWHITE: extract time variant embedded wavelets with Roy White's method
%
% [wavelets,tws]=extract_wavelets_roywhite(s,t,r,t0s,twins,wlen,mu,stab,fsmo,method,pctnotcausal)
%
% Given a seismic trace and a corresponding reflectivity, this function estimates the
% time-varying embedded wavelets at user-defined times and windows using the method atributed
% to Roy White (Walden and White, 1998). The wavelets are not constrained to be causal. This
% function calls waveest_roywhite to estimate the wavelet in each time zone after isolating
% trace segments in the defined windows. Roy White's method assumes the convolutional model
% s=w*r. Cross correlate both sides with r to get w*rxr=sxr. Thus, the wavelet can be estimated
% by deconvolving rxr from sxr. In method 'one', rxr is assumed to be a Delta function and
% hence no deconvolution is required. In method 'two', rxr is deconvolved in the frequency
% domain and a stability constant is employed in the denominator. The correlation spectra are
% also smoothed by frequency domain boxcar convolution. Gamma-squared weighting is employed.
% This is the method advocated by Walden and White (1998). In method 'three', rxr is
% deconvolved in the time domain and a smoothness constraint (as is done in matchs) is
% employed. Method three is new here. In all three methods, the final wavelet scale factor
% (overall amplitude) is determined by least-squares subtraction.
%
% s ... input seismic trace
% t ... time coordinate for s
% r ... reflectivity (time domain)
% NOTE: s,t, and r must all be exactly the same size. This usually means
%       that you must isolate the postion of your seismic that correlates to r.
% t0s ... vector of wavelet extraction times. These are the center times of
%       the extraction windows.
% twins ... vector of window widths. May be a vector the same length as t0s
%       or a single entry if the windows are the same length.
% NOTE: t0s and twins must be vectors of the same length, or twins must be
%       a scalar.
% wlen ... length of the estimated wavelet expressed as a fraction of
%          twins. Since the wavelets are least-squares match filters, it is
%          possible to prescribe this length and this acts as a control.
%          Allowing too long a wavelet will match anything to anything
%          else, while too short a wavelet can lead to overly pessimistic
%          results.
% *********** default = 0.25 ************
% mu ... method three only: mu(1) = smoothness weight mu(2) =  time constraint weight
%  Both values can be any nonnegative number. [0 0] turns off both constraints.
%  *********** default [1 10] ***********
% stab ... stability constant to avoid zero divide. Method 'two' only.
%  *********** default .01 ***********
% fsmo ... frequency domain smoother size in Hz. Method 'two' only.
% ************ default 5 ***********
% method ... either 'one' or 'two' or 'three'. See waveest_roywhite.
%  *********** default 'three' ************
% pctnotcausal ... only for method three. Percentage of the estimated wavelet that is not causal. 
%           This means the percenatge of the wavelets samples that occur before time t=0.
%   Examples
%           pctnotcausal=0 ... a fully causal operator is desired. t=0 is the first sample.
%           pctnotcausal=10 ... 10% of the samples will occur before t=0
%           pctnotcausal=50 ... 50% of the sample will be before t=0. This is the
%                   time-symmetric case.
% NOTE: Fully causal operators, even if the wavelet is known to be causal, are generally not as
%       good as those where pctnotcausal is slightly greater than 0 (say 2 through 10). If yhe
%       causality of the wavelet is unknown, the 50 is the recommended value.
% *********** default pctnotcausal=50 ***********

% wavelets ... cell array of extracted wavelets, the same length as t0s
