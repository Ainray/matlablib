function [result,a]=lsqsubtract(sig1,sig2,iwin)
% LSQSUBTRACT: least squares subtraction
%
% [result,a]=lsqsubtract(sig1,sig2,iwin)
% result=lsqsubtract(sig1,sig2)
%
% LSQSUBTRACT calculates result=sig1-a*sig2 where a is a scalar chosen such that
% "result" has a minimal L2 norm. The signals are assumed to be real
% valued.
% sig1 ... first input signal, if a matrix it will be formed into a column vector
% sig2 ... second input signal, if a matrix it will be formed into a column vector
% NOTE: sig1 and sig2 must be vectors of the same size.
% iwin ... vector of indices defining a segment of the input signals to be
%   used to determine the least squares scalar.
% ************* default 1:length(sig1) ******************
% NOTE: if sig1 and sig2 are matrices, then iwin is assumed to apply to dimension 1
% result ... the value of sig1-a*sig2
% a ... the scalar a
