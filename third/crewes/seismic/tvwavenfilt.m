function seis=tvwavenfilt(seis,t,x,y,tspec,sigmax,sigmay)
%
% seis=tvwavenfilt(seis,t,x,y,tspec,sigmax,sigmay)
%
% Apply a time-variant wavenumber filter (as a Gaussian mask) to a 3D dataset. This is equivalent to
% a time-variant spatial convolution on time slices. The usual gaussian is a decaying exponential
% but a growing one, a spatial deconvolution, is also accomodated. This function calls
% wavenumber_gaussmask2 to implment the filter on each time slice. This can be a useful process
% after a spectral whitening application with Gabor decon or TVSW. An alternative is tracemix3D.
%
% seis ... input 3D dataset. First dimension is time, second ix x (xline) and third is y (iline).
%       Must be resularly sampled in all three dimensions. 
% t ... time coordinate vector, length(t) must equal size(seis,1).
% x ... x coordinate vector, length(x) must equal size(seis,2).
% y ... y coordinate vector, length(y) must equal size(seis,3).
% tspec ... vector of times at which the spatial filter sizes are specified.
% sigmax ... vector of standard deviations of the Gaussian mask in the x direction expressed as a 
%       fraction of x spatial Nyquist, eg a value of .25 means .25*kxnyq. length(tspec) must equal
%       length(sigmax). Negative values for sigmax signify that the mask is division by a Gaissian
%       which causes spatial deconvolution (sharpening) while positive values cause spatial
%       convolution (blurring). Generally, sigmax should be a number between -1 and +1. However,
%       values greater than 1 are allowed and the larger it is the less action. Values of 10 or
%       greater are taken as a flag for no action and such time slices are simply passed to output.
% sigmay ... Just like sigmax except for the y direction. x and y filtering actions can be completley 
%       independent.
% *********** default sigmay=sigmay **************
% 
% seis (outout) ... 3D seismic matrix the same size as the input with the spatial filtering applied
%
% NOTE: Because we are effectively convolving each time slice with a different size spatial filter,
% there is a possible time-variant amplitude effect. At present, this is addressed by balancing
% input to output rms power on each time slice.
