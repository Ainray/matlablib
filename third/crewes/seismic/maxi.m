function [ccmax,taumax]=maxi(cc,tau,taufrac)
% MAXI: find the maximum of a time series interpolated to the nearest 1/10 th sample
%
% [ccmax,taumax]=maxi(cc,tau,taufrac)
%
% MAXI first finds the maximum value on a sample. It then takes 10 samples to each side of this
% maximum and does a band-limited interpolation (using interpbl) to 1/10th of the sample size and
% finds the maximum of that interpolated segment.
%
% cc ... input time series (usually a crosscorrelation but can be anything)
% tau ... time coordinate vector for cc (same size as cc)
% taufrac ... fractional sample size of the interpolated result
% ************ default = 10 ***********
% The default means that the result is interpolated to 1/10 th of the input sample size
% flag2 ... if 1, then the actual maximum is determined. If 2, then the max(abs()) is determined
% ************ default =1 ***************
%
% ccmax ... interpolated maximum of cc
% taumax ... time at which the interpolated maximum occurs
