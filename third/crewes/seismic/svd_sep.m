% SVD_SEP: singular value decomposition separation into Gross and Detail
%
% [seisg,seisd]=svd_sep(seis,singcut,dim,flag)
%
% Those unfamiliar with SVD (singular value decomposition) should examine the function svd first. A
% second step is to view your matrix with seisplotsvd_sep in order to determine the input parameter
% singcut. The basic idea here is to use SVD to separate a matrix into Gross and Detail parts. These
% are matrices the same size and class as the input where Gross contains the large-scale features
% and Detail contains the small-scale features. The input matrix is recreated by the simple
% summation of Gross and Detail. This is a 2D operation so if the input matrix is 3D then the
% separation is done on each "slice" where the dimension "dim" (usually the first) is held constant.
% The input can be single or double precision but the SVD is always done at double precision and the
% result is returned in the same precision as the input. For each slice, an SVD (see svd) is
% performed on the slice to divide it into two components: sliceg (Gross) is dominated by the
% largest singular values while sliced (Detail) is dominanted by all of the others. Adding sliceg
% and sliced reproduces the input slice to machine accuracy. This decomposition is achieved by
% defining a Gaussian of the form g(j)=exp(-(j-1)^2/jcut^2) where j is the singular value number
% (j=1:nsing where nsing is the number of singular values and j=1 is the largest -most important-
% singular value). Let the singular value decomposition of the input slice be slice=U*S*V' where S
% contains the singular values on its diagonal (again see help on svd). Then let s be the diagonal
% entries of S (all other entries are zero) and sliceg is defined by sliceg=U*diag(s.*g)*V' where
% diag(s.*g) is the diagonal matrix like S except that the singular values are windowed by g.
% Defining d=1-g, sliced is given by sliced=U*diag(s.*d)*V' and it follows that sliceg+sliced=slice
% and sliceg and sliced have the mentioned properties. Given this separation, many further
% possibilities exist. For example, see svd_wavenumber_filt and svdgaussianmask.
%
% seis ... input seismic matrix, either 2D or 3D
% singcut ... cutoff singular value defining the separation between Grodd and Detail. This is jcut
%           in the description above.
% dim ... dimension held constant for the separation. Has no effect if seis is 2D.
% *********** default = 1 *************
% flag ... 0 means the singular-value cutoff function is a bimodal boxcar
%          1 means the singular-value cutoff function is a Gaussian
%
% seisg ... matrix of the same size and class as seis containing the Gross structure of seis
% seisd ... matrix of the same size and class as seis containing the Detail of seis
% singg ... singular values for Gross. Each column of singg contains the singular values for the
%           correswponding slice of seisg. There is nothing useful that can be done with these
%           without the U-V matrices. They are just provided for interest.
% singd ... like singg except for Detail.
