function [A,f]=aveampspec(seis,t,t1,t2)
% AVEAMPSPEC ... compute the average amplitude spectrum of a seismic gather
%
% [A,f]=aveampspec(seis,t,t1,t2)
% 
% A default raised-cosine window (see mwindow) is used.
%
% seis ... the seismic gather (matrix)
% t ... time coordinate for seis
% NOTE: length(t) must equal size(seis,1)
% t1 ... start time for spectrum. Must be a scalar
% t2 end time for spectrum. Must be a scalar
