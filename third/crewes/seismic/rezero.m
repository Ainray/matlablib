function seis3D=rezero(seis3D,zeromap)
% REZERO: return empty traces in a 3D seismic matrix to zero
%
% seis3D=rezero(seis3D,zeromap)
%
% A 3D seismic survey (post-stack) will usually have an iregular footprint in the lateral
% coordinates. That is when viewed in map view, the survey boundary is not a perfect rectangle but
% rather is some irregular shape. In order to store it in a 3D matrix, it must be padded with zero
% traces out to the smallest rectangle that encloses the survey. seis3D should be a 3D seismic
% matrix whose first dimension is time, the second dimension is x, and the third dimension is y.
% zeromap is a 2D matrix whose row dimension corresponds to the seismic x and whose column dimension
% corresponds to the seismic y. Wherever zeromap is zero, the corresponding trace in seis will be
% set to zero. See the note below for an example of creating zeromap.
%
% seis3D (input) ... 3D survey with traces that need to be set to zero.
% zeromap ... 2D matrix inidcating which traces in seis3D should be set to zero. Dimension 1 of
%           zeromap must match dimension 2 of seis3D and dimension 2 of zeromap must match dimension
%           3 of seis3D. Wherever zeromap==0, the corresponding trace will be set to zero.
% seis3D (output) ... identical to the input seis3D except that the trace locations indicated in
%       zeromap are now also zero in seis3D.
%
% NOTE: The easiest way to create zeromap is to sum the last few samples of a same-size seismic
% volume in which the proper traces are already zero. For example, let seis3Dz be a a 3D seismic
% volume with the proper traces set to zero, and let seis3D be the result of processing seis3Dz in
% such a way that the zero traces become nonzero. For example, a spatial filter run on time slices
% (e.g. tvwavenfilt) will have this effect. Then, if nt is the number of time samples in seis3Dz
% (the size of dimension 1), the zero map can be created by
% zeromap=squeeze(sum(abs(seis3Dz(nt-10:nt,:,:))));
% The choice to sum the last 10 samples in each trace here is arbitrary but it does assume that if
% the final 10 samples of a trace are zero, then the entire trace is zero. This is usually the case
% but there are bound to be exceptions.
