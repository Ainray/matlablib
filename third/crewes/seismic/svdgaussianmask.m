%
% For each time-slice of a 3D dataset, apply SVD separation to separate the slice into Gross and
% Detail (see svd_sep) and then apply wavenumber filters to both Gross and Detail before recombining. 
% The wavenumber filters are generally different for Gross and Detail usually being more severe for
% the former. The filters are applied as Gaussian masks in the wavenumber domain with each mask
% being specified by its standard deviations in x and y. The five parameters of the process can all
% be time-variant. The normal Gaussian mask is a decaying exponential but a growing one, a spatial
% deconvolution, is also allowed.
%
% seis ... input 3D dataset. First dimension is time, second ix x (xline) and third is y (iline).
%       Must be resularly sampled in all three dimensions. 
% t ... time coordinate vector, length(t) must equal size(seis,1).
% x ... x coordinate vector, length(x) must equal size(seis,2).
% y ... y coordinate vector, length(y) must equal size(seis,3).
% tspec ... vector of times at which the spatial filter sizes are specified.
% sigmax ... vector of standard deviations of the Gaussian mask to be applied to Gross in the x
%       direction expressed as a fraction of x spatial Nyquist, eg a value of .25 means .25*kxnyq.
%       length(tspec) must equal length(sigmax). Negative values for sigmax signify that the mask is
%       division by a Gaussian which causes spatial deconvolution (sharpening) while positive values
%       cause spatial convolution (blurring). Generally, sigmax should be a number between -1 and
%       +1. However, values greater than 1 are allowed and the larger it is the less action. Values
%       of 10 or greater are taken as a flag for no action and such time slices are simply passed to
%       output.
% sigmay ... Just like sigmax except for the y direction. x and y filtering actions can be
%       completley independent.
% sigmaxB and sigmayB ... Just like sigmax and sigmay except they are for filtering Detail.
% singcut ... vector of singular value cuttoffs, the same length as tspec
% flag ... 0 means the singular-value cutoff function is a bimodal boxcar
%          1 means the singular-value cutoff function is a Gaussian
% *********** default flag=1 **************
% 
% seis (output) ... 3D seismic matrix the same size as the input with the spatial filtering applied
%
% NOTE: Because we are effectively convolving each time slice with a different size spatial filter,
% there is a possible time-variant amplitude effect. At present, this is addressed by balancing
% input to output rms power on each time slice.
%
% NOTE2: To determine the input parameters for this process, view your data in plotimage3D. View a
% time-slice of interest and right-click in to to launch the wavenumber filtering tool.
