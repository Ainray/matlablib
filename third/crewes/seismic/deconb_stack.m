function [stackd,d]=deconb_stack(stack,t,itr,tstart,tend,top)
% DECONB_STACK: applies Burg decon to a stacked section
%
% [stackd,d]=deconb_stack(stack,t,itr,tstart,tend,top,stab)
%
% DECONB_STACK applies deconb (Burg deconvolution) to all traces in a
% stack. Either each trace can deconvolved independently or the operator
% can be designed from a specific trace and applied to the entire
% section. The deconvolution design gate is constant from trace-to-trace.
%
% stack ... stacked section as a matrix of traces.
% t ... time coordinate for stack
% itr ... trace number to design operator on. Set this to 0 for
%       trace-by-trace operation.
% tstart ... start of the decon design window
% tend ... end of the decon design window
% top ... length of decon operator in seconds
%  ****** default 0.1 ******
% 
% stackd ... deconvolved stack
% d ... deconvolution operator (for trace-by-trace mode, this is an average
%       operator)
% The estimated wavelet is found by w=ifft(1./fft(d));
