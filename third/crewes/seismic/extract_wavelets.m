% EXTRACT_WAVELETS_MATCH: extract time variant embedded wavelets with match filtering
%
% [wavelets,tws]=extract_wavelets_match(s,t,r,t0s,twins,wlen,mu,icausal)
%
% Given a seismic trace and a corresponding reflectivity, this function
% estimates the time-varying embedded wavelets at user-defined times and
% windows. The wavelets are not constrained to be causal.
% This function calls MATCHS to estimate the wavelet in each time zone after
% isolating trace segments in the defined windows. The
% windowed trace is compared to the windowed reflectivity to estimate each
% wavelet. Using MATCHS to estimate the wavelets means that they are
% derived by least-squares time-domain match filtering with a smoothness
% constraint.
%
% s ... input seismic trace
% t ... time coordinate for s
% r ... reflectivity (time domain)
% NOTE: s,t, and r must all be exactly the same size. This usually means
%       that you must isolate the postion of your seismic that correlates to r.
% t0s ... vector of wavelet extraction times. These are the center times of
%       the extraction windows.
% twins ... vector of window widths. 
% NOTE: t0s and twins must be vectors of the same length
% wlen ... length of the estimated wavelet expressed as a fraction of
%          twins. Since the wavelets are least-squares match filters, it is
%          possible to prescribe this length and this acts as a control.
%          Allowing too long a wavelet will match anything to anything
%          else, while too short a wavelet can lead to overly pessimistic
%          results.
% *********** default = 0.25 ************
% mu ... tradeoff parameter between wavelet smoothness and data fitting.
%       Lower means less smooth with 0 being no smoothness constraint. 
%       Smoothness is imposed via a constraint in the match filter
%       inversion (see matchs). A value between 0 and 1 is recommended
% *********** default mu=0.01 ************
% icausal ... 0 for noncausal, 1 for causal
% *********** default = 0 **********
%
%
% wavelets ... cell array of extracted wavelets, the same length as t0s
% tws      ... cell array of wavelet time coordinates, the same length as t0s
