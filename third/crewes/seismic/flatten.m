% 
% [seisflat,dtau]=flatten(seis,t,x,te,xe,twid)
%
% seis ... input seismic section
% t ... time coordinate vector for seis
% x ... space coordinate vector for seis
% NOTE: seis must be a matrix of size nt rows and nx columns where nt is
%   the number of time samples and nx is the number of traces. The t must
%   be a column vector of length nt and x must be a row vector of length
%   nx.
% te ... time of event on seis that will guide the cross correlation to
%       determine the flattening time shifts
% xe ... x coordinate of the guide event.
% NOTE: te and xe must be scalars
% twid ... determines the width of the correlation time window. It goes
%        from the event time + or minus 2*twid. So twid is the 1/4 width.
%        It is in seconds.
