function seiszf=wavenumber_highpass(seisz,x,y,sigmax,sigmay)
% WAVENUMBER_HIGHPASS: apply a 2D high-pass wavenumber filter to a depth section or slice.
%
% seiszf=wavenumber_highpass(seisz,x,y,sigmax,sigmay)
%
% It is often desirable to apply a filter that suppresses the lower wavenumbers on a seismic time or
% depth slice or on a depth section.  In the latter case, this might be useful after RTM.  This
% function does that by performing a 2D FFT on the slice and then pointwise multiplying the
% wavenumber spectrum by a Gaussian mask. The Gaussian mask has the same dimensions as the spectrum
% and is just 1-g(kx,ky) where g(kx,ky) is a 2D Gaussian centered at the origin with the specified
% standard deviations. In the case of a 2D depth section, interprete ky as the vertical wavenumber.
%
% seisz ... input time slice or detph section. If a time slice, the column coordinate is x and the
%       row coordinate is y. If a depth section, the column coordinate is x and the depth (row)
%       coordinate is y.
% x ... coordinate for the columns of seisz. Can be either a scalar or a vector. If a scalar it is
%       assumed to be the x coordinate spacing. If a vector, the length(x) must equal size(slice,2).
%       x should be in physical units like feet or meters (i.e. not linenumber) so that wavenumbers
%       are calculated correctly. Must be regularly spaced for the FFT.
% y ... similar to x but for the rows of seisz.
% sigmax ... stdev of mask in kx expressed as a fraction of kxnyq. That is the actual stddev is
%               sigmax*kxnyq. Should be a positive number.
% sigmay ... similar for sigmax but in the ky direction
%   ********** default is sigmay=sigmax **************
%
% seiszf ... the wavenumber filtered slice or depth section
