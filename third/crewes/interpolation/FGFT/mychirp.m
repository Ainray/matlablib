function [d,t,cf] = mychirp(f0,f1,dt,nt)
%mychirp: computes a hyperbolic chirp
%
%
% IN.   f0,f1  : freq at t=0 and freq at t=tmax
%       dt     : sample interval
%       nt     : number of samples
% OUT.  d(nt)  : chirp
%       cf     : Instantaenous frequency of the chirp
%       t      : time axis
%
% Example:
%          [d,t,cf] = mychirp(10,40,0.004,200); 
%          subplot(221); plot(t,d);
%          subplot(222); plot(t,cf);
