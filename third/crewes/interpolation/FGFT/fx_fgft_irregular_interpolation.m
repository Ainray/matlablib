function Y=fx_fgft_irregular_interpolation(X,H,nh)
% This function interpolates irregularly sampled seismic traces using
% a fast generalized Fourier transform. The Spitz method of using the low
% frequency portion for the interpolation of high frequencies is used.
%
%% Input
%   X: Data in t-x domain (with zero in the location of missing traces.
%
%
%% Output
%   Y: Interpolated data
