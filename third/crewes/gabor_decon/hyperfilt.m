function sf=hyperfilt(s,t,t0,fmin,fmax,fmaxmax,phase,max_atten,option,twin)
% hyperfilt ... time variant bandpass filter whose passband follows hyperbolic trajectories
%
% sf=hyperfilt(s,t,t0,fmin,fmax,fmaxmax,phase,max_atten,option,twin)
%
% In the time-frequency plane, curves of t*f=constant are hyperbolae. If
% the min and max frequencies of a bandpass filter are specified at some
% time, t0, then the they can be automatically adjusted to follow a
% hyperbolic trajectory. This gets a wider passband for t<t0 and a narrower
% one for t>t0.
%
% s ... seismic trace to be filters
% t ... time coordinate vecotr for s
% t0 ... time at which filter specs apply
% fmin ... a two element vector specifying:
%         fmin(1) : 3db down point of filter on low end (Hz)
%         fmin(2) : gaussian width on low end
%    note: if only one element is given, then fmin(2) defaults
%          to 5 Hz. Set to [0 0] for a low pass filter 
% fmax ... a two element vector specifying:
%         fmax(1) : 3db down point of filter on high end (Hz)
%         fmax(2) : gaussian width on high end
%    note: if only one element is given, then fmax(2) defaults
%          to 20% of (fnyquist-fmax(1)). Set to [0 0] for a high pass filter
% fmaxmax ... after adjusting fmax for t<to, it will not be allowed to
%           exceed this value.
%     ********** default fmaxmax = .8*fnyq *********
% phase... 0 ... zero phase filter
%          1 ... minimum phase filter
%          any other number ... constant phase rotation of that
%		   many degrees
%  ****** default = 0 ********
% note: Minimum phase filters are approximate in the sense that
%  the output from FILTF is truncated to be the same length as the
%  input. This works fine as long as the trace being filtered is
%  long compared to the impulse response of your filter. Be wary
%  of narrow band minimum phase filters on short time series. The
%  result may not be minimum phase.
% 
% max_atten= maximum attenuation in decibels
%   ******* default= 80db *********
% option ... 1 means only the high-end parameters follow a hyperbolae
%            2 means both low and high end follow hyperbolae
%   ******* default = 1 **********
% twin ... half-width in seconds of Gaussian Gabor windows to be used
%   ******* default = .1 seconds *********
%
% sf ... output filtered trace
