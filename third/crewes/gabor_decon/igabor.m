% IGABOR: inverse Gabor transform
%
% [trout,t]=igabor(tvs,trow,fcol,twin,tinc,p,gdb,normflag,pow2option)
% 
% IGABOR performs an inverse Gabor transform of a Gabor spectrum. This is
% implemented with a modified Gaussian synthesis window of unity. This is
% the inverse of fgabor. Parameters with the same name as those in fagabor
% must have exactly the same values here for a proper inverse.
%
% tvs ... input time variant spectrum or Gabor spectrum. This is typically
%      created by FGABOR.
% trow ... time coordinate vector for the rows of tvs
% fcol ... frequency coordinate vector for the columns of tvs
% twin ... half-width (seconds) of the Gaussian window
% tinc ... temporal shift (seconds) between windows
% p ... exponent used in analysis windowing. If g is the modified Gaussian
%   window then the synthesis window actually used is g.^(1-p) . 
%   The value of p must lie in the interval [0,1]. 
% ************** default = 1 ***************
% gdb ... number of decibels below 1 at which to truncate the Gaussian
%   windows. This should be a positive number. Making this larger
%   increases the size of the Gabor transform but gives marginally better
%   performance.
% ************** default = 60 ***************
% ************** the gdb feature is presently disabled **********
% normflag ... 1 means divide each window by the computed normalization
%   factor, 0 means don't divide.
% ************** default =1 ***************
% pow2option ... 1 means expand each window to a power of two in length
%            ... 0 don't expand
% ************** default = 1 *************
%
% NOTE: It is essential to use the same windowing parameters, including the
%   p and gdb values in IGABOR as in FGABOR.
% trout ... output time series
% t ... time coordinate vector for trout
