function prr=tvprr(r,rp,t,twin,tinc)
% TVPRR: time-variant measurement of portion refelctivity resolved (PRR) (used to assess deconvolution)
%
% prr=tvprr(r,rp,t,twin,tinc)
% 
% PRR, or portion reflectivity resolved, is a measurment of the quality of a deconvolved
% seismic trace compared to a real reflectivity. Usually the deconvolved trace, rp, is created
% by deconvolving an estimated wavelet from a seismic trace, while the real reflectivity, r, is
% computed from well logs. PRR is defined as prr=1-sum((r-rp).^2)/sum(r.^2)). The term being
% subtracted from 1 is the energy of the residual reflectivity (r-srp) divided by the energy of
% the true reflectivity. To make this process time-variant, a Gaussian window is defined, with
% a given width and center time, and applied to both r and rp befor the calculation. Repeating
% this for a complete set of window locations spaiing the length of the trace completes the
% process. Prior to the start of the calculation, rp is scaled to minimize the sum((r-rp)) (as
% performed on the entire trace - no windowing). This allows for the likely case that rp is off
% by a constant scalar.
%
% r ... input real reflectivity
% rp ... input estimated reflectivity
% t ... time coordinate for both r and rp
% NOTE: r, rp, and t must all be identically sized column vectors. This usually means that rp
% must be shortened before calling this function.
% twin ... half-width of Gaussian window in seconds.
% *********** default (t(end)-t(1))/10 **********
% tinc ... increment between adjacent windows in seconds. Note that tinc should be a good deal
%       less that twin.
% *********** default twin/4 ***********
%
% prr ... output prr vector. It has mesurements every tinc seconds but has been interpolated to
%       be the same size as t.
