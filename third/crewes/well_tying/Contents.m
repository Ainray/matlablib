% CREWES Well-tying toolbox
%
% G.F. Margrave's tools
% ALIGN_REF   - GUI tool to adjust temporal alignment of reflectivity and seismic traces
% PENPRED - compute the portion of energy predicted by a convolutional synthetic
% TEST_WAVELET_EXPLORER - script to test the wavelet explorer
% TVPEP - time-variant measurement of portion energy predicted (PEP) (used to assess well ties)
% TVPRR - time-variant measurement of portion refelctivity resolved (PRR) (used to assess deconvolution)
% WAVEEX_MATCH - GUI based wavelet explorer for match filter method
% WAVEEX_RW - GUI based wavelet explorer for Roy White method
% WAVEEX_SIMPLE - GUI based wavelet explorer for the simple method
% WAVELET_STATS - measures dominant frequency, delay, and phase rotation of a wavelet.
% WELLTIE - perform well tying by time-variant stretch and time-variant phase rotation
% 
% Heather Lloyd's tools
% BCARSMOOTH  - convolutional smoothing with a boxcar
% CLIPLOGS    - Nuke outliers on a log
% CONSTPHSANALYZE  - GUI tool for constant phase rotation estimation
% CSCALI      - Check shot calibration of a sonic log
% ENVELOPEMATCH  - (Possibly similar to align_ref) is a gui interface that will allow the user to alter a sonic
% LOGOVERBURDEN  - attaches an overburden to a log using several methods
% MODIFYSONIC - adjusts a sonics to match picks. Used by STRETCHWELL
% REMOVENULL - sremoves NULL values from a log
% SEISMOTZ - Compute a synthetic seismogram using different sonics for reflectivity and time-depth conversion
% STRETCHWELL - is a gui interface that will allow the user to alter a sonic
% TVLSPHSROT - not sure. Seems to be time-variant least squares phase rotation
% WAVELETESTIMATOR - is a gui interface that will allow the user to estimate a wavelet
