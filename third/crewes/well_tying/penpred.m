function pep=penpred(s,r,w,tw)
% PENPRED: portion of energy predicted
% pep=penpred(s,r,w,tw)
% 
% PEP = portion of energy predicted
%
% Method: Given a seismic trace, a reflectivity, and a wavelet, the wavelet and reflectivity are
% convolved together and the result is compared to the seimic trace. The PEP is defined as 
% PEP= 1-Energy(s-conv(r,w))/Energy(s).
% Where Energy(x)=sum(x.^2). Notice that if s is exactly matched by conv(r,w) then PEP is 1. Also
% notice that the formula assumed that s and conv(r,w) are balanced in overall amplitude. This
% function takes care of that by determining the best(least-squares) scalar to be applied to
% conv(r,w) to minimize Energy(s-conv(r,w)). (See lsqsubtract for more on this).
% 
% s ... seismic trace
% r ... reflectivity
% NOTE: s and r must be the same length
% w ... wavelet
% tw ... time coordinate for wavelet.(Needed to deterine time zero of the
%       wavelet)
% NOTE: If w and tw are not provided, then r is used directly as if it is already convolved.
