% WELLTIE: perform well tying by time-variant stretch and phase rotation
%
% [stie,sreftie,tstretch,tphase]=welltie(s,t,sref,tref,twin,tinc,flag,envflag,padflag,bwflag)
%
% Given a fully processed seismic trace and a reference trace that is either a synthetic seismogram
% or a reflectivity produced from well logs, the seismic trace is "tied" to the reference by
% measuring time-variant delays and time-variant phase rotations. It is important to do a rough
% time-alignment of the reference trace prior to running this. This usually amounts to simply
% changing the start time of the reference trace by a constant time shift that represents the
% unlogged overburden. The well tying process here consists of mesuring time-variant time-shifts and
% time-variant phase rotations. Once measured, the default action is to apply the time-shifts to the
% reference trace (since they are time variant, this is a stretch) and the phase rotations to the
% seismic trace. Optionally, both can be applied to the seismic trace.
% Method: 
%   (1) Transfer the seismic bandwidth to the reference trace (see bandwidth_xfer)
%   (2) Check for polarity and flip s if necessary
%   (3) Measure time-variant time shift by tvmaxcorr using trace envelopes.
%       Using trace envelopes here helps to avoid the usual coupling
%       between time-shifts and phase rotations.
%   (4) Apply the measured time shifts to either the reference trace (the
%       default) or the seismic trace.
%   (5) Measure time-variant phase rotations using tvconstphase.
%   (6) Apply phase rotations to the seismic trace.
% It is expected that the reference trace will be shorter than the seismic trace. However, the
% longer the reference trace the better. If the reference trace is less than half the length of the
% seismic, consider creating a composite log using several wells with different depth ranges. Also
% be aware that shifts and rotations for times outside the range of the reference trace are simply
% constant extrapolations.
%
% s ... input seismic trace to be "tied"
% t ... time coordinate for s (same size as s)
% sref ... reference trace (seismogram at well with zero phase wavelet)
% tref ... time coordinate for sref (same size as sref)
% twin ... half width of Gaussian window used for time variant localization. The maximum 
%       expected time shift should be less than twin. A common value would be 0.1 or 0.2.
%       Optionally, this can be a vector of length 2 where the second entry is the length of a
%       boxcar smoother applied to the trace envelopes. If not specified, then the smoother is
%       calculated as 0.1*twin(1).
% tinc ... increment between windows. Typically tinc would be about twin/4.
%       A smaller tinc can detect more rapid time variance. Optionally, this can be a vector of
%       length 2 where the second value gives the maximum allowed cc lag. If not specified this
%       value is 0.4*twin(1).
% flag ... determines how phase rotations and times shifts are applied
%           0: Don't apply phase rotations. Time shifts still applied to sref in
%               order to measure phase.
%           1: Apply phase rotations to s and time shifts to sref
%           2: Apply both phase rotations and time shifts to s
%           3: Apply both phase rotations and time shifts to sref
% ******** default flag=1 ********
% envflag ... 0 means the delays are estimate by cross correlating traces
%             1 means the delays are estimate by cross correlating envelopes
% ******** default envflag=1 *********
% padflag ... 0 means the adjusted reference trace is the same size as sref
%             1 means the adjusted reference trace is the same size as s
% ******** default padflag=0 *********
% bwflag ... 0 means do not transfer the bandwidth from s to sref
%            1 means transfer the bandwidth from s to sref
% ******** default bwflag=1 *******
% stie ... adjusted seismic trace
% sreftie ... adjusted reference trace
% tstretch ... measured and applied time shifts (same size as t)
% tphase ... measured and applied phase rotations (same size as t)
%
% To apply the time shifts to another trace, say s2, use
%   s2s=stretcht(s2,t,-tstretch); if shifts are applied to the reference trace and s2 is another reference trace
%   s2s=stretcht(s2,t,tstretch); if shifts are applied to the seismic trace and s2 is another seismic trace
% To apply the phase rotations use
%   s2sr=tvphsrot(s2s,t,-tphase,t);
% Note the minus sign in the phase rotations and that the rotations are applied after shifting.
% This is the case if flag=2 was used. For flag=1, then the reference trace has been shifted
% and the phase rotations should be applied directly to s2 with the opposite sign.
%  s2sr=tvphsrot(s2,t,tphase,t);
