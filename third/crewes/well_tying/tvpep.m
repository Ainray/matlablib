function pep=tvpep(s,sp,t,twin,tinc)
% TVPEP: time-variant measurement of portion energy predicted (PEP) (used to assess well ties)
%
% pep=tvpep(s,sp,t,twin,tinc)
% 
% PEP, or portion energy predicted, is a measurment of the quality of a synthetic seismogram
% compared to a real trace. Usually the seismogram, sp, is created as a convolution with an
% estimated wavelet and the reflectivity measured at the well, while the real trace, s, is from a
% final section at a location near the well. PEP is defined as pep=1-sum((s-sp).^2)/sum(s.^2)).
% The term being subtracted from 1 is the energy of the residual trace (s-sp) divided by the
% energy of the trace. To make this process time-variant, a Gaussian window is defined, with a
% given width and center time, and applied to both s and sp befor the calculation. Repeating
% this for a complete set of window locations spaiing the length of the trace completes the
% process.
%
% s ... input real seismic trace
% sp ... input synthetic seismogram
% t ... time coordinate for both s and sp
% NOTE: s,sp, and t must all be identically sized column vectors. This usually means that s
% must be shortened before calling this function.
% twin ... half-width of Gaussian window in seconds.
% *********** default (t(end)-t(1))/10 **********
% tinc ... increment between adjacent windows in seconds. Note that tinc should be a good deal
%       less that twin.
% *********** default twin/4 ***********
%
% pep ... output pep vector. It has mesurements every tinc seconds but has been interpolated to
%       be the same size as t.
