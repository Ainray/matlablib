## Overview

exportToPPTX allows user to create PowerPoint 2007+ (PPTX) files without using COM-objects automation (or PowerPoint application itself). Proper XML files are created and packaged into PPTX file that can be read and displayed by PowerPoint.

*Note about PowerPoint 2003 and older:* To open these PPTX files in older PowerPoint software you will need to get a free office compatibility pack from Microsoft: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3

If another filename is provided, then changes will be written to the new file (effectively a 'Save As' operation). Returns full name of the presentation file written.

```matlab
exportToPPTX('close')
```

```matlab
exportToPPTX('saveandclose')
```

Shortcut to save and close at the same time. No additional inputs required. No outputs.

```matlab
exportToPPTX('query')
```

Returns current status either to the command window (if no output arguments) or to the output variable. If no presentation is currently open, returned value is null.

## Markdown

Any textual inputs (addtext, addnote) support basic markdown formatting: 
- Bulleted lists (lines start with "-")
- Numbered lists (lines start with "#")
- Bolded text (enclosed in "\*\*") Ex. this **word** is bolded
- Italicized text (enclosed in "\*") Ex. this *is* italics
- Underlined text (enclosed in "\_") Ex. this text is _underlined_

## Basic Example

Here is a very simple example

```matlab
% Start new presentation
exportToPPTX('new','Dimensions',[6 6]);

% Just an example image
load mandrill; figure('color','w'); image(X); colormap(map); axis off; axis image;

% Add slide, then add image to it, then add box
exportToPPTX('addslide');
exportToPPTX('addpicture',gcf,'Scale','maxfixed');
exportToPPTX('addtext','Mandrill','Position',[0 5 6 1],'FontWeight','bold','HorizontalAlignment','center','VerticalAlignment','bottom');

% Save and close
exportToPPTX('save','example.pptx');
exportToPPTX('close');
```

More elaborate examples are included in `examples_exportToPPTX.m` and `examples2_exportToPPTX.m` files.

## Notes about Templates

In order to use PowerPoint templates with exportToPPTX a basic knowledge of the structure of the template is required. You will need to know master layout name (especially if there are more than one master layout), slide layout names, and placeholder names on each layout slide. There are multiple ways of getting this information. 

The easiest way of getting template structure information is to open the presentation in PowerPoint and to look under Layout drop-down menu on the Home tab. Master name will be given at the top of the list. Layout names will be listed under each slide thumbnail. Placeholder names are not easy (if not impossible) to get to from PowerPoint itself. But typically they are named with obvious names such as Title, Content Placeholder, Text Placeholder, etc. 

Alternative way of getting template structure information is to open presentation template with exportToPPTX and run `query` which will list out all available master layouts, slide layouts, and placeholders on each slide layout. Here is an example with the included `Parallax.pptx` template:

```matlab
>> exportToPPTX open Parallax
>> exportToPPTX
	File: C:\Stefan\MatLab_Work\exportToPPTX\Parallax.pptx
	Dimensions: 13.33 x 7.50 in
	Slides: 0
	Master #1: Parallax
		Layout #1: Content with Caption (Title 1, Content Placeholder 2, Text Placeholder 3, Date Placeholder 4, Footer Placeholder 5, Slide Number Placeholder 6)
		Layout #2: Name Card (Title 1, Text Placeholder 2, Date Placeholder 3, Footer Placeholder 4, Slide Number Placeholder 5)
		Layout #3: Section Header (Title 1, Text Placeholder 2, Date Placeholder 3, Footer Placeholder 4, Slide Number Placeholder 5)
		Layout #4: Blank (Date Placeholder 1, Footer Placeholder 2, Slide Number Placeholder 3)
		Layout #5: Quote with Caption (TextBox 13, TextBox 14, Title 1, Text Placeholder 9, Text Placeholder 2, Date Placeholder 3, Footer Placeholder 4, Slide Number Placeholder 5)
		Layout #6: Vertical Title and Text (Vertical Title 1, Vertical Text Placeholder 2, Date Placeholder 3, Footer Placeholder 4, Slide Number Placeholder 5)
		Layout #7: Title and Content (Title 1, Content Placeholder 2, Date Placeholder 3, Footer Placeholder 4, Slide Number Placeholder 5)
		Layout #8: Title and Vertical Text (Title 1, Vertical Text Placeholder 2, Date Placeholder 3, Footer Placeholder 4, Slide Number Placeholder 5)
		Layout #9: Title Slide (Freeform 6, Freeform 7, Freeform 9, Freeform 10, Freeform 11, Freeform 12, Title 1, Subtitle 2, Date Placeholder 3, Footer Placeholder 4, Slide Number Placeholder 5)
		Layout #10: Title Only (Title 1, Date Placeholder 2, Footer Placeholder 3, Slide Number Placeholder 4)
		Layout #11: Title and Caption (Title 1, Text Placeholder 2, Date Placeholder 3, Footer Placeholder 4, Slide Number Placeholder 5)
		Layout #12: Comparison (Title 1, Text Placeholder 2, Content Placeholder 3, Text Placeholder 4, Content Placeholder 5, Date Placeholder 6, Footer Placeholder 7, Slide Number Placeholder 8)
		Layout #13: True or False (Title 1, Text Placeholder 9, Text Placeholder 2, Date Placeholder 3, Footer Placeholder 4, Slide Number Placeholder 5)
		Layout #14: Panoramic Picture with Caption (Title 1, Picture Placeholder 2, Text Placeholder 3, Date Placeholder 4, Footer Placeholder 5, Slide Number Placeholder 6)
		Layout #15: Two Content (Title 1, Content Placeholder 2, Content Placeholder 3, Date Placeholder 4, Footer Placeholder 5, Slide Number Placeholder 6)
		Layout #16: Picture with Caption (Title 1, Picture Placeholder 2, Text Placeholder 3, Date Placeholder 4, Footer Placeholder 5, Slide Number Placeholder 6)
		Layout #17: Quote Name Card (TextBox 13, TextBox 14, Title 1, Text Placeholder 9, Text Placeholder 2, Date Placeholder 3, Footer Placeholder 4, Slide Number Placeholder 5)
```

Once you have all this structure information available it's easy to use templates with exportToPPTX. When creating new slide specify which slide layout you want to use. When adding text, images, or tables to the slide, instead of giving exact position and dimensions of the element, simply pass in the placeholder name. 

Here is a another simple example:

```matlab
% Open presentation template
exportToPPTX('open','Parallax.pptx');

% Add new slide with layout #9 (Title Slide)
exportToPPTX('addslide','Master',1,'Layout','Title Slide');	

% Add title text and subtitle text
exportToPPTX('addtext','Example Presentation','Position','Title'); 
exportToPPTX('addtext','Created with exportToPPTX','Position','Subtitle');

% Save as another presentation and close
exportToPPTX('save','example2');
exportToPPTX('close');
```

`Parallax.pptx`, included with this tool, is one of the default PowerPoint templates distributed with Microsoft Office 2013.
