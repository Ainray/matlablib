function tp=VSP_pick(vsp,t,z,tfb,zfb,twin,option)
% VSP_pick: picks the first arrival times on a vsp
%
% tp=VSP_pick(vsp,t,z,tfb,zfb,twin,option)
%
% vsp ... vsp data stored as a matrix. one trace per depth, traces in
%       columns.
% t ... time coordinate vector for vsp 
% z ... receiver coordinate (depth) vector for vsp 
% tfb ... vector of at least two times giving the approximate
%       first break time at the first and last receiver depths.
% zfb ... vector of the same length as tfb giving depths of the times in
%       tfb
% twin ... picking window. Picks will be found within +/-twin of the
%       trajectory defined by tfb and zfb
% ****** default = .1 *****
% option ... 1 use sta/lta picking algorithm. sta and lta stand for short
%               term average and long term average.
%            2 use super-duper mystery picking
% ****** default = 1 *******
%
% tp ... vector of first break times, one for each depth
%
% Example:
% >> tp=VSP_pick(vsp,t,z,[0 .4],[0 1000]);
% >> plotimage(vsp,t,z); hold on
% >> plot(z,tp,'r*')
