% VSP_separation: separate a VSP into downgoing and upgoing waves
% 
% [vspdown,vspup,vspupflat,tpup]=VSP_separation(vsp,t,zr,tp,nmed,nmix,npasses)
%
% VSP_separation separates a VSP wavefield into downgoing and upgoing waves.
% The separation procedure is the conventional one of (1) flattening the
% downgoing primary wave by applying the first break picks as static
% shifts (see VSP_flatten), (2) applying a spatial median filter to
% suppress the upgoing wave, (2b) optionally applying a trace mix, (3)
% subtracting the median filtered, flattened, wavefield from the initial
% flattened wavefield. The result of (3) represents the estimate of the
% upgoing wave but flattened on the downgoing primary. Unflattening the
% results of (3) and (2) gives estimates of the upgoing wave and the
% downgoing wave in original time. Given the first break picks, it is also
% possible to flatten the upgoing wave. Thus the three wavefields returned
% are the downgoing and upgoing in original time and the upgoing flattened.
% At present the option exists to iterate the procedure of steps 2-3 any
% number of times. Testing suggests there is not much benefit to this.
%
% vsp ... input vsp matrix. One trace per column
% t   ... time coordinate for vsp
% zr  ... depth coordinate for vsp. Currently this is not used so you can
%         make it anything. 
% tp  ... vector of first arrival times for the primary downgoing wave.
%         There must be one value per trace. You can use PICKER for this.
% Requirement: length(t) must equal size(vsp,1) AND length(tp) must equal
%               size(vsp,2).
% nmed ... number of points in the median filter. This should be either a
%           scalar or a vector of length 2. If a scalar then the median
%           filter length is the same in all passes. If a length 2 vector,
%           then the first number is for pass 1 and the second number is
%           for the last pass. Intermediate passes will use an interpolated
%           value. See VSP_medfilt for details.
%   Suggestion: an odd number greater than 5.
% nmix ... Size of the spatial mix (equally weighted) applied immediately
%   after median filtering. This should be either a scalar or a vector
%   of length two. the values are used as described with nmed. See tracemix
%   for details on the mixing. Its good to make this an odd number.
% *************** default =1 (no mixing) ***************
% npasses ... number of passes
% *************** default = 1 *************
% 
% vspdown ... downgoing wave
% vspup   ... upgoing wave
% vspupflat ... flattened upgoing wave
% tpup ... vector of time shifts needed to flatten upgoing wave using VSP_flatten
