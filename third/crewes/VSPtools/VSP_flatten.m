function vspflat=VSP_flatten(vsp,t,tp,dir,tshift)
% VSP_flatten: flatten an event on a vsp by static shifts
% 
% vspflat=VSP_flatten(vsp,t,tp,dir,flag)
%
% vsp ... input vsp matrix. One trace per column
% t   ... time coordinate for vsp
% tp  ... vector of times for the event to be flattened. There must be one
%       value per trace.
% Requirement: length(t) must equal size(vsp,1) AND length(tp) must equal
%               size(vsp,2).
% 
% dir ... 1 means to flatten 
%         -1 means to unflatten
% tshift ... constant shift to subtract from tp. This is useful if the event being
% flattened extends to near t=0. Once flattened, such an event may be too
% close to t=0 for comfort. 
% **********  default = 0 *********
%
% vspflat ... output flattened (or unflattened) vsp
