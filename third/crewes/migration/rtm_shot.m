%
% RTM_SHOT does pre-stack reverse-time depth migration of a shot record. The migration computes the
% forward-in-time propagation of the source field and the reverse-time propagation of the input shot
% (receiver field). Thus two wavefields (source wavefield and receiver wavefield) are simulated
% by finite-difference time stepping. The migrated shot (or reflectivity estimate) comes from
% crosscorrelation of these two fields at equal times. The crosscorrelation is a 2D (x,z) dot-star
% (.*) operation. This requires that the source wavefield must be available at each time step of the
% receiver field and this is a major complexity. Here this is addressed by fully propagating the
% source field before the reverse-time propagation is begun and saving the needed snapshots of the
% source field in a 3D array. Rather than correlation at each time step (dtstep) the correlation is
% done at time intervals of itcorr*dtstep where itcorr>=1. This allows a control on the memory
% requirements and itcorr must be an integer. A good choice for itcorr is round(dt/dtstep). Also
% required is a wavelet for the source simulation. Ideally this should be the same wavelet that is
% embedded in the receiver field (shot record). All time stepping is second order. At each step of
% the reverse-time propagation, a new row of samples from the shot record is injected into the
% receiver field at the receiver locations. The spatial derivatives can be calculated with a five or
% nine point approximation to the Laplacian operator. The five point approximation is faster, but
% the nine point results in a broader bandwidth.  The two laplacian options have different stability
% conditions (see below).
%
% shot ... the input seismic stack to be migrated. Each column is a trace
%       and each row is a time sample.
% t ... time coordinate vector for shot. length(t) must equal size(shot,1)
% xrec ... space coordinate vector for shot. length(x) must equal size(shot,2)
% zrec ... depth coordinates of the receivers. Enter a scalar 0 to place all rreceivers at the z=0,
%       otherwise, it must be a vector the same size as xrec.
% NOTE: t must be regularly sampled but xrec need not be. The propagation grid size is determined by xv.
% xshot, zshot ... x and z coordinates of the shot (scalars for point souce, same-length vectors for an array)
% w,tw ... the wavelet and its time coordinate. The wavelet may be noncausal. Must be sampled at dtstep.
% vel = the input velocity model. This must be instantaneous velocity as a function of x (columns) 
%       and z (rows). Vel must be on a square regular grid of spatial sample size dx=xv(2)-xv1);
% xv = horizontal coordinate for the velocity model. The velocity model can span a longer x range
%       than the shot record but must be no smaller. The depth coordinate of vel is generated
%       internally as dx*(0:size(vel,1)-1)' . The dx of vel determines the square propagation grid
%       on thich the computation occurs.
% dtstep = size of time step (in seconds). dtstep must be no greater than dt=t(2)-t(1). 
%       For best results dtstep should be about dt/10 .
% itcorr = the source and receiver fields will be correlated (.*) every itcorr*dtstep seconds. itcorr
%       must be an integer no smaller than 1. Note that setting this equal to 1 will require large
%       memory. The .* operation gets the instantaneous reflectivity estimate while the final
%       reflectivity is the sum over time of the instantaneous reflectivites.
% *********** default = round(dt/dtstep) where dt=t(2)-t(1) *********
% tout = array of times at which output snapshots are desired
% ********** default = [] (no snapshots) ************
% laplacian - an option between two approximations to the laplacian operator
%           - 1 is a 5 point approximation
%          Stability condition: max(velocity)*dtstep/dx MUST BE < sqrt(2)
%           - 2 is a nine point approximation
%          Stability condition: max(velocity)*dtstep/dx MUST BE < sqrt(3/8)
% ********* default = 2 ************
% NOTE: dx in the stability formulae is dx=abs(xv(2)-xv(1));
% illume ... if 1 then the illumination is computed at each correlation step and used to normalize
%           the correlation. Illumination is the square (.^2) of the source field. Otherwise, the
%           reflectivity estimate at each time is simply the correlation (.*) of the source and
%           receiver fields. Division of the correlation by the illumination (./) is effectivlty a
%           correction for the amplitude loss caused by wavefront spreading.
% ********* default = 1 ************
% boundary = indicate which sides of the velocity matrix are absorbing
%          = 0 indicates that no absorbing boundaries are desired
%          = 1 indicates all four sides are absorbing
%          = 2 choses sides and bottom to be absorbing, and the top not to be. (Top is a free
%          surface). This enables sources to be put on the surface because placing them on an
%          absorbing boundary tends to be defeating.
% ********** default = 2 *********
%
% shotm = the migrated shot in depth. This will be the same size as the velocity model.
% shotmf = the migrated shot with Laplacian filter applied
% xm = the x coordinate of the migrated shot (same as xv)
% zm = the depth coordinate of the migrated shot (same as depth axis of the velocity model)
% recsnaps = cell array of snapshots of the reverse-time propagated receiver wavefield at the times tout
% sousnaps = cell array of snapshots of the forward-time propagated source wavefield at the times tout
% refsnaps = cell array of snapshots of the reflectivity image (the migrated shot) at the times tout
% xms = x coordinate for the snapshots
% zms = z coordinates for the snapshots
%
% NOTE: The depth migrated shot will be the same size as the velocity model. Its up to the user
% to ensure this is large enough to prevent unwanted boundary interactions.
