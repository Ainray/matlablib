% GAUSSIAN_SMOOTHER: smooth a velocity model by conv2 with a Gaussian
%
% velsmo=gaussian_smooother(vel,x,z,hw)
%
% Function smooths a velocity model by convolving it with a 2D Gaussian.
% The smoothing is actually done by convolving the Gaussian with slowness
% (1./vel) and then inverting the result. This has the effect of roughly
% conserving traveltime.
% The Gaussian is specified with a certain halfwidth and is truncated at
% two halfwidth. The velocity model is extended for two halfwidth's in
% every direction (constant extrapolation) to avoid edge effects. After
% convolution it is truncated to the original size
% vel ... 2D velocity matrix
% x ... vector of x coordinates for the velocity model. Length must be the
%       same as the number of columns of vel. Alternativly, this may be
%       specified as a single scalar in which case it is the horizontal
%       grid size
% z ... similar to x but for depth coordinates
% hw ... half-width of the Gaussian smoother in consistent spatial units
% velsmo ... smoothed velocity matrix the same size as vel
