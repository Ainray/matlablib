function editlinesinit(anchorinfo)
% EDITLINESINIT: called to initiate editing with EDITLINES.
%
% To use EDITLINES in a tool of your own crafting, it is usually necessary 
% to have the graphics handles of the lines to be edited if precise control
% over the editing process is to be maintained. Suppose that there are three
% (x,y) curves on display in the current axes of the current figure and let
% their handles be hline1, hline2, and hline3 and let their coordinates be
% given by vectors: x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3.  Then the following sequence
% initiates  editing, terminates editing, and retrieves the edited (x,y)'s:
%
% editlinesinit; .... Begin editing. All three curves are available for
%                     editing. Editing occurs for an indefinite period of time
% editlinesfini; .... Terminate the editing session
% x1=get(hline1,'xdata'); ... get line 1's x coodinates after editing
% y1=get(hline1,'ydata'); ... get line 1's y coodinates after editing
%
% By supplying an argument to editlinesinit, you can control which curves
% may be edited and if there are any initial anchor points on the curves.
% (See anchor points below). (Note that editlinesinit with no argument means
% everything is editable).  For example:
%
% editlinesinit({hline1 0 hline3 0}) ... line 2 may not be edited. Lines
%                                        1&3 have no anchor points
% editlinesinit({hline1 1 x1(10) y1(10) hline2 2 x2(5) y2(5) x2(15) ...
%               y2(15) hline3 0})
%	... this means all three lines may be edited. Line one has a single
%	    anchor at the point x1(10) y1(10); line2 has 2 anchors at the
%	    fifth and 15th points; while line 3 has no anchors.
% editlinesinit({hline1 1 x1(10) y1(10) hline2 2 x2(5) y2(5) x2(15) ...
%               y2(15) hline3 -eps})
%	... Similar to the previous case except that line 3 is flagged as having no anchors but
%	being available for immediate editing.
% For more information on the structure of the anchors array, examine the private function
% el_init and the comments beginning on line 41.
%
% The argument to editlinesinit is called the anchor vector and gives
% quite general control over editing. editlinesfini returns an updated
% anchor vector in the same format as the input but with any changes which
% the user has made. Thus it can be saved and supplied to editlinesinit to
% resume editing in the same state. 
%
% There are also several different modes that editlines can be run in.
% Modes are activated at anytime in a editing session by an apporpriate 
% call to editlines:
%
% editlines('xonly') ... changes cannot be made to the y coordinates of 
%                        any point.
% editlines('yonly') ... changes cannot be made to the x coordinates of 
%                        any point.
% editlines('xandy') ... frees both x and y for changes
% editlines('linkmode') ... toggles between link mode and normal mode
% editlines('dragmode') ... toggles between constant drag and elastic drag
% editlines('constantdrag') ... sets drag mode to constant
% editlines('elasticdrag') ... sets drag mode to elastic
%
% Note that these calls are on-off toggles. That is if editing is already 
% in 'xonly' mode then: editlines('xonly') will free up the x coordinates 
% for editing.   Also, if both 'xonly' and 'yonly' are on then no changes 
% can be made.
%
% Lastly, editlines('undo') will undo changes made since the last mouse down.
