function [mm,a]=ismin(w);
% ISMIN: test a wavelet (time series) for minimum phase
%
% [mm,a]=ismin(w)
%
% ISMIN factors the z transform of the input and determines if all zeros
% lie outside the unit circle (minimum phase) or not.
%
% w ... wavelet
% mm ... returned as 1 if w is minimum phase, 0 if not
% a ... vector of absolute values of the zeros of w. These
%       must all be greater than 1 for minimum phase.
