function [g,x,y]=gaus_radial(dx,sigmax,dy,sigmay,nhw)
% GAUS_RADIAL: makes a 2D radial Gaussian suitable for convolutional smoothing
% 
% [g,x,y]=gaus_radial(dx,sigmax,dy,sigmay,nhw)
% 
% dx ... grid size in x (physical units) (distance between columns)
% sigmax ... Gaussian half-width (standard deviation) in x 
% dy ... grid size in y (physical units) (distance between rows)
% ********** default dy=dx **********
% sigmay ... Gaussian half-width (standard deviation) in y
% ********** default sigmy=sigmax ***********
% nhw ... number of half widths that the gaussian spans. The resulting radial gaussian will
% extend from -nhw*sigmax to +nhw*sigmx in x and similarly in y. The number of samples in both
% dimensions will be odd.
% ********** default nhw=3 **********
% 
% g ... the 2D radial Gaussian
% x ... x coordinate for g
% y ... y coordinate for g
%
% Example:
% [g,x,y]=gaus_radial(1,50,1,50,3);
% figure;surf(x,y,g);shading flat
