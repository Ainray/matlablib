function tf = isebcdic(txt)
%
% function dibm = ibm2double(txt)
% Where:
%     txt  = character vector
% Returns: true or false
% Warning: This is a guess
%
% This function assumes that ASCII text will not have any characters where
% uint8(txt) > 127, but there is overlap between ASCII and EBCDIC - so the
% chances of a correct answer go up with increasing length of txt
