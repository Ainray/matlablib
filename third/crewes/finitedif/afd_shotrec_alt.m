% [seisw,t]=afd_shotrec_alt(dx,dtstep,dt,tmax,model,xshot,zshot,xrec,zrec,wlet,tw,laplacian,boundary)
%
%
% AFD_SHOTREC will create a shot record given a velocity model and source 
% and receiver configutations. 
% Two input snapshots of the wavefield, one at time=0-dtstep and one at 
% time=0, are used in a finite difference algorithm to propogate the 
% wavefield.  The finite difference algorithm can be calculated with a 
% five or nine point approximation to the Laplacian operator.  The five 
% point approximation is faster, but the nine point results in a 
% broader bandwidth. Note that the velocity and grid spacing must 
% fulfill the equation max(velocity)*dtstep/dx < 0.7 for the model 
% to be stable.  The source array is included in the input 
% wavefield matrices, snap1 and snap2, and the receiver locations are defined
% by the user. Receiver arrays are not explicitely provided though they
% can be simulated after-the-fact by appropriate spatial convolutions.
% Of the two required snapshots, commonly they are either set equal to each other
% or the earlier one (snap1) is set to zero. These give different initial
% conditions. Two seismograms are returned:  one including all frequencies, and
% the other filtered by a gaussian function specified by the user.
%
% dx = the bin spacing for both horizontal and vertical (in consistent units)
% dtstep = size of time step for modelling (in seconds)
% NOTE: dx and dtstep must satisfy the stability condition for the chosen Laplacian. See the
% discussion below.
% dt = size of time sample rate for output seismogram. dt<dtstep causes resampling.
%		 dt>dtstep is not allowed. This allows the model to be oversampled for
%		 propagation but then conveniently resampled. Often dt is much
%		 greater than dtstep. This meanst that grid dispersion will be
%		 minimal in the frequency band defined by dt.
%		 The sign of dt controls the phase of the antialias resampling filter.
%		 dt>0 gives minimum phase, dt<0 is zero phase. Resampling is of course
%		 done at abs(dt). 
% tmax = the maximum time of the seismograms in seconds
% model = This is either a matrix containing the input velocity model or a cell 
%        array of two matrices, the first being the velocity model and the
%        second the density model. If the former case, then density is
%        assumed constant. If the latter case, then the velocity and
%        density matrices must be exactly the same size. The two grids must
%        have values in consistent units. If vel is the velocity matrix,
%        and den the density matrux, then putting these together in a cell
%        array is done by: model={vel;den}; .  Note that the velocity matrix
%        must be first and density second.
%        Must have the same size as snap1 and snap2
% xshot = array of x coordinates of the desired shot points (in consistent units)
% zshot = array of z coordinates of the desired shot points (in consistent units)
% xrec = a vector of the x-positions of receivers (in consisent units)
% zrec = a vector of the z-positions of receivers (in consistent units)
% wlet or filter = a 4 component ' Ormsby ' specification = [f1 f2 f3 f4] in Hz
%        or a wavelet. If it is longer than four elements, it is assumed to be
%      a wavelet. The wavelet should be sampled at the time step sample rate
%      (dtstep)
% tw or phase ... If a the previous input was a four point filter, then this must
%     a scalar where 0 indicates a zero phase filter and 1 is a minimum phase
%     filter. If the previous input was a wavelet, then this is the time 
%     coordinate vector for the wavelet. The time sample rate of the wavelet MUST
%		equal dtstep.
% laplacian - an option between two approximation to the laplacian operator
%           - 1 is a 5 point approximation
%           STABILITY CONDITION: max(velocity)*dtstep/dx MUST BE < sqrt(2)
%           - 2 is a nine point approximation
%           STABILITY CONDITION: max(velocity)*dtstep/dx MUST BE < sqrt(3/8)
%  ************** default = 1***********
% Note: laplacian=2 generally gives a much more accurate result but laplacian=1 is much faster. A
% good strategy is to use laplacian=1 for initial testing to determine model features and other
% details. Then choose laplacian=2 for a better quality result.
%
% boundary = indicate whether all sides of the matrix are absorbing
%          = 0 indicates that no absorbing boundaries are desired
%          = 1 indicates all four sides are absorbing
%          = 2 choses three sides to be absorbing, and the top one not to be
%             this enables sources to be put on the surface
% *************** default = 2 **********
%
% Warning: a shot placed on the surface z=0 with boundary=1 will not work
%       well.

% seisw = the output seismogram (wavelet applied)
