function [shots,t,xshots,xrecs,shotnames]=afd_shootline(dx,vel,dt,dtstep,w,tw,tmax,nshots)
% AFD_SHOOTLINE ... shoot a 2D seismic line over a numerical model
%
% [shots,t,xshots,xrec]=afd_shootline(dx,vel,dt,dtstep,w,tw,tmax,nshots)
%
% dx ... spatial grid size of the velocity model (grid cell must be square)
% vel ... velocity matrix
% dt ... desire output time sample rate. This should usually be .004. It is
%        usually a waste of time to try for more out of a finite difference
%        simulation.
% dtstep ... time step size for the finite difference simulation. For
%        stability, it must be less than sqrt(3/8)*dx/max(vel(:)).
% w ... desired wavelet. Can be causal or non causal. Create this with
%       something like, wavemin, ricker, ormsby, wavez, or similar. It must be
%       sampled at the rate dt (not dtstep).
% tw ... time coordinate vector for w
% tmax ... maximum desired record time. If in doubt, run with a single shot
%       record first and check the results.
% nshots ... desired number of shot records. These will be placed at
%       regular intervals across the model. The actual locations are determined
%       by the funtion nominal_line_geom. Unless you want to wait a long
%       time, make this something like 20 or less.
%
% shots ... cell array of output shot gathers
% t ... time coordinate for the output traces
% xshots ... vector of shot locations
% xrecs ... cell array of receiver locations. Note that all shots will have
%           the same receivers positions. That is we simulate laying our a line of
%           receivers and shooting through it.
