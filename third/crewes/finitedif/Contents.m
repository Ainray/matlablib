% CREWES finite difference seismic modelling
% Acoustic finite difference modelling toolbox
%
% Sample scripts and demo's
% HIGHV_WEDGE - model an anticline beneath a high velocity wedge
% VZANTICLINE - model an anticline beneath a v(z) medium
% CHANNEL - model a channel beneath a few layers
% THRUST_EXPLODE - exploding reflector model of high-angle thrust
% SYNCLINE - demo buried syncline with and without reverse-time branch
% DEMO_SHOOTLINE - demo shooting a 2D line and stacking it
% DEMO_AFD_MAKESNAPSHOTS - demo making wave propagation snapshots and displaying them in plotgathers
%
% Seismograms and simulations
% AFD_SHOTREC - makes finite difference shot records
% AFD_SHOTREC_ALT - alternate version which inputs the wavelet differently
% NOTE: afd_shotrec propagates an impulse and then convolves the wavelet
%   with the result. In contrast, afd_shotrec_alt injects the wavelet sample-by-sample at each time
%   step. Mathematically, these should be the same but there are numerical differences.
% AFD_EXPLODE - makes exploding reflector models
% AFD_SHOOTLINE - shoot a 2D line over a given model
% AFD_MAKESNAPSHOTS - make a series of wave propagation snapshots, you
%                       can view these with either plotsnaps or plotgathers. 
%                       See demo_afd_makesnapshots.
