% [seisw,seis,t]=afd_shotrec(dx,dtstep,dt,tmax,model,snap1,snap2,xrec,zrec,wlet,tw,laplacian)
%
%
% AFD_SHOTREC will create a shot record or VSP given a velocity model and source and receiver
% configutations using second-order finite-difference time stepping. The wave equation being
% simulated is either constant density but variable velocity or both variable density and variable
% velocity. This is controlled by the model parameter. See also AFD_SHOTREC_ALT for an alternative
% method of source injection. AFD_SHOTREC is the more intuitive source specification but
% AFD_SHOTREC_ALT may be preferred for movie making or other applications. In AFD_SHOTREC the
% sources are propagated as impulses and the resulting seismogram is filtered after creation by the
% desired source wavelet. In AFD_SHOTREC_ALT the source wavelet is injected sample-by-sample during
% the time stepping.
%
% The source wavelet may be either causal or noncausal. This method propagated the source as an
% impulse at time 0 and then applies the wavelet aftewards by convolution. Source locations (and
% implicitly the initial conditions) are specifed by providing two input snapshots of the wavefield,
% one at time=0-dtstep (i.e. one time step before source initiation) called snap1 and one at time=0
% called snap2. The simplest scheme makes snap1=zeros(size(velocity)) meaning that the wavefield is
% zero before source initiation. Then snap2 is similarly initialized to zero followed by the
% placement of unit impulse(s) at the source location(s). For example:
% snap2=zeros(size(velocity));snap2(1,round(size(velocity,2)/2)); places a unit source at the
% surface midway along the model. Source arrays are simulated by simply placing more impulses.
% Source location and strength are arbitrary.
%
% The finite difference algorithm can run with a five or nine point approximation to the Laplacian
% operator.  The five point approximation (second order in space) is faster, but the nine point (4th
% order) results in a broader bandwidth.
% 
% The final seismogram has one column per receiver and the number of rows is round(tmax/dt)+1.
% Receiver arrays are not explicitly provided although they can be simulated after-the-fact by
% appropriate spatial convolutions. Receivers may be placed anywhere in the model at locations
% specified by the xrec and zrec arrays. For example, xrec=dx*(0:size(velocity,2)-1);
% zrec=zeros(size(xrec)) places receivers at the surface at each grid location as is suitable for a
% typical shot record. On the other hand, a VSP can be simulated by zrec=dx*(0:size(velocity,1)-1);
% xrec=ones(size(zrec))*1000; This places receivers in a vertical borehole (column) from the top to
% the bottom of the velocity model at x coordinate of 1000.
%
% The user must ensure that the finite-difference stability conditions are met or the function will
% refuse to proceed. This involves choosing dtstep such that
%        dtstep <= a*dx/vmax
% where vmax is the maximum velocity found anywhere in the velocity model and a=1/sqrt(2) for the
% second order Laplacian (5 pt) and a=sqrt(3/8) for the fourth order Laplacian (9 pt). Note that
% reducing the spatial grid size (dx) generally requires that dtstep also decrease.
%
% dx = the grid size for both horizontal and vertical (in consistent units) dimensions. THuse the
%       simulation takes place on a square grid. This value must be consistent with the model
%       parameter. Changing this value will not cause the model to be resampled. This must be done
%       prior to running this function.
% dtstep = size of time step for modelling (in seconds). this parameter
%       must be chosen to ensure stability. See the discussion below
%       following the parameter "laplacian".
% dt = size of time sample rate for output seismogram. dt<dtstep causes resampling.
%		 dt>dtstep is not allowed. This allows the model to be oversampled for
%		 propagation but then conveniently resampled. Often dt is much
%		 greater than dtstep. This meanst that grid dispersion will be
%		 minimal in the frequency band defined by dt.
%		 The sign of dt controls the phase of the antialias resampling filter.
%		 dt>0 gives minimum phase, dt<0 is zero phase. Resampling is of course
%		 done at abs(dt). 
% tmax = the maximum time of the seismograms in seconds
% model = This is either a matrix containing the input velocity model or a cell 
%        array of two matrices, the first being the velocity model and the
%        second the density model. If the former case, then density is
%        assumed constant. If the latter case, then the velocity and
%        density matrices must be exactly the same size. The two grids must
%        have values in consistent units. If vel is the velocity matrix,
%        and den the density matrux, then putting these together in a cell
%        array is done by: model={vel;den}; .  Note that the velocity matrix
%        must be first and density second.
% snap1 = the wavefield at time=0 - dtstep.  (same size as velocity matrix)
%       This matrix determines the x and z sizes of the simulation. It should
%		be mostly zeros except for islotated ones corresponding to sources.
% snap2 = the wavefield at time = 0 (same size as velocity matrix)
%       This matrix represents the sources after one dtstep time step. Its often
%		acceptable to make this equal snap1.
% xrec = a vector of the x-positions of receivers (in consisent units)
%		The left hand column of snap1 is x=0.
% zrec = a vector of the z-positions of receivers (in consistent units)
%       The top row of snap1 is z=0. 
% wlet or filter = a 4 component ' Ormsby ' specification = [f1 f2 f3 f4] in Hz
%        or a wavelet. If it is longer than four elements, it is assumed to be
%      a wavelet. The wavelet should be sampled at the output sample rate
%      (dt)
% tw or phase ... If a the previous input was a four point filter, then this must
%     a scalar where 0 indicates a zero phase filter and 1 is a minimum phase
%     filter. If the previous input was a wavelet, then this is the time 
%     coordinate vector for the wavelet. The time sample rate of the wavelet MUST
%		equal dt.
% laplacian - an option between two approximation to the laplacian operator
%           - 1 is a 5 point approximation
%           STABILITY CONDITION: max(velocity)*dtstep/dx MUST BE < 1/sqrt(2)~ 0.7071
%           - 2 is a nine point approximation
%           STABILITY CONDITION: max(velocity)*dtstep/dx MUST BE < sqrt(3/8)~ 0.6124
%  ************** default = 1***********
% Note: laplacian=2 generally gives a much more accurate result but laplacian=1 is much faster. A
% good strategy is to use laplacian=1 for initial testing to determine model features and other
% details. Then choose laplacian=2 for a better quality result.
