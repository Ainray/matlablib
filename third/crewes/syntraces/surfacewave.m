%
% [sw,tsw]=surfacewave(dt,tmax,tlength,tnot,amp,fdom)
%
% A simple waveform model of a surface wave is returned in an otherwise
% empty trace. The surface wave is a sine wave of frequency "fdom"
% multiplied by a Gaussian of the form exp(-(2*(tsw-tnot)/tlength).^2). The
% peak amplitude of the sine wave is "amp". This is not based on any
% physical theory.
%
% dt ... time sample interval in seconds
% tmax ... total record length of the trace that the surface wave is placed in
% tlength ... approximate temporal duration of the surface wave
% *********  default = .4 seconds or .4*tmax whichever is less **********
% tnot ... time of the amplitude maximum of the surface wave
% ********* default = tmax/2
% amp ... strength of the surface wave
% ************ default = 1 *************
% fdom ... vector of dominant frequencies in Hz
% ************ default = 6:15 ***********
