% SEISMO: create a Goupillaud seismogram directly from log data
%
% [sgram,tlog,rcs,pm,p]=seismo(sonic,dens,z,fmult,fpress,wlet,tw,tmin,tmax)
%
% SEISMO computes a 1-D seismic model (seismogram) from well
% log information. It uses the sonic log to build a time-depth
% curve and then calls SEISMOGRAM. (See SEISMOGRAM help for more info)
%
% sonic ... vector of sonic log samples. Must be in typical sonic
%	units (e.g. micro-sec/meter).
% dens ... vector of same length as sonic giving density values.
%	For a constant density result, provide this as ones(size(sonic)).
% z ... vector of same size as sonic giving the depths of the log.
% fmult ... multiple flag
%            0 -> produce a primaries only convolutional seismogram
%            1 -> produce a primaries (with attenuation losses) plus
%                  multiples seismogram
% fpress ... flag for a pressure or displacement seismogram
%            1 -> a pressure seismogram is desired
%            0 -> a displacement seismogram is desired
%          For a pressure seismogram, the source is a unit compression. For
%          a displacement seismogram, the source is a unit displacement in
%          the positive z (down) direction.
% w ... wavelet 
% tw ... time coordinate for wavelet
% tmin ... minimum output time
% ******* default = 2*z(1)/vtop where vtop is the velocity at log top******
% tmax .... maximum output time 
% ******* default = 2-way traveltime to log bottom *******
%
% wlet ... vector of wavelet samples
%   Wavelets can be generated using any of WAVEMIN, WAVEZ, WAVEVIB,
%   RICKER, and FILTF in the Seismic_Toolbox
% tw ...  vector of time coordinates for the wavelet. Note that
%         a non-causal wavelet should have tw(1)<0. The convolution
%         will be such that the wavelet sample at tw==0 will be
%         superimposed on the reflectivity spike
%
% sgram ... n length vector containing the seismogram samples.
%         (n is determined by the algorithm).
% tlog ... nlength vector containing the times for the seismogram
%	rcs ... n length vector of computed reflection coefficients in time
%  pm ... nlength vector of attenuated primaries plus multiples. 
%         If fmult == 0, this is identical to rcs.
%	p ... nlength vector with attenuated primary rcs. If fmult==0, this
%         is identical to rcs. If fmult==1, then the multiple content can
%         be obtained as: pm-p
