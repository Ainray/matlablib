function [w,tw]=wavevib(fmin,fmax,dt,slength,wlength,taper)
% WAVEVIB: creates a vibroseis (Klauder) wavelet
%
% [w,tw]=wavevib(fmin,fmax,dt,slength,wlength,taper)
%
% WAVEVIB generates a vibroseis waveform (Clauder wavelet) by
% first calling SWEEP to generate a linear sweep and then calling
% AUTO to autocorrelate that sweep. Theoretically, the autocorrelation
% length is ~ 2*slength but only only the central 'wlength' long
% part is generated. This is like windowing the auto with a boxcar.
%
%
% fmin= minimum swept frequency in Hz
% fmax= maximum swept frequency in Hz
% dt= time sample rate in seconds
% slength= sweep length in seconds
% wlength= desired wavelet length
%  taper= length of cosine sweep taper in seconds
%  ********** default =.5 if tmax>4.0
%             otherwise =.25 *************
%
% w= output wavelet
% tw= time coordinate vector for w
