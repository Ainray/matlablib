% WATERBTM computes the impulse response for a zero offset water
%  bottom multiple.
%
% twater= vertical traveltime thickness of the water (2-way)
% t= time coordinate vector. This will determine the sample rate
%    and length of mtrain
% rc= reflection coefficient of the water bottom
% ********** default =.2 *************
% flag= 0 ... produce the combinde response (source and receiver
%             multiples combined)
%       1 ... only the source multiples are desired
