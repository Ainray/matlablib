function [s,t,rcs,pm,p]=seismo1D(sonic,rho,z,w,tw,vsurf,fmult,fpress,tmax)
% SEISMO1D computes a 1D normal incidence p-wave reflection seismogram with or without multiples.
%
% [s,t,rcs,pm,p]=seismo1D(sonic,rho,z,w,tw,vsurf,fmult,fpress,tmax)
%
% METHOD: The input logs are resampled (or blocked) to have constant 2-way time-thickness layers. The
% time-thickness is equal to the sample rate of the wavelet. This is done because it allows the
% traveltimes of the multiples to be easily computed from the number of bounces. Then the impedance
% of the resampled logs is computed and from that the reflectivity. If no multiples are desired,
% then the seismogram is simply obtained by convolving the reflectivity with the wavelet. If
% multiples are desired, then the reflectivity is run through the Goupillaud scattering algorithm. 
% Either a pressure or a displacement seismogram can be computed with the former being the choice
% for marine and the latter for land. If R is a reflection coefficient and Wi the incident wave on a
% reflector and Wr the reflected wave, then for pressure Wr=R*Wi while for displacement Wr=-R*Wi.
% Note that this assums R to be defined by R=(I2-I1)/(I2+I1) where I1 is the incident medium and I2
% the the transmitted medium. When multiples are computed, they can be isolated by the subtraction
% pm-p but you will probably want to apply the wavelet for most purposes. Note that when fmult=1, 
% the primaries are computed with transmission losses while for fmult=0, the primaries are identical
% to the rcs for a pressure seismogram and are the negative of the rcs for a displacement seismogram.
% The algorithm will show scattering Q (the O'Doherty-Anstey effect) when fmult=1 but the degree of 
% Q effect will increase with decreasing wavelet sample rate due to the time-thickness blocking.
%
% To make a synthetic not based on a real well log, you must craft artificial logs. To do this, 
% choose a depth sample size that is about ten times smaller than .5*dt*vintmin where dt is the desired 
% time sample size and vintmin is the minimum interval velocity. Compute the sonic values from the 
% formula sonic = 10^6 ./vint . Density values can have arbitrary units.
%
% sonic ... p-wave sonic log.
%           Note that inteval velocity is computed from the sonic by 10^6 ./sonic and this works
%           regardless of the units of the sonic.
% rho  ... density log. The seismogram is not sensitive to units of density since they cancel when 
%           computing reflection coefficients.
% z ... depth coordinate for the logs.
% NOTE: the first three arguments must all be the same length. There must be no NULL values in the
%   logs but the depths need not be regularly space although they must always be increasing. The
%   depth sample size should always be much smaller than .5*dt*vint where dt is the wavelet sample
%   rate and vint is the slowest interval velocity impled by the sonic.
% NOTE: logs must be defined with valid physical values at all depths. No NULLS.
% w ... wavelet. The wavelet is only applied to the first output (not to rcs, pm, and p).
% tw ... time coordinate for the wavelet. The time sample rate of the wavelet (tw(2)-tw(1))
%       determines both the log blocking and the time sample rate of the outputs.
% vsurf ... p-wave velocity at the earth's surface. The overburden velocity will then be described 
%           as a linear gradient from the surface value to the average value (over ten samples) at
%           the log top. To craft your own overburden, just define your logs to zero depth. Use NAN
%           to get the default. The seismogram always starts at t=0 while the first reflectivity
%           occurs at the start depth of the log. The time of the first reflectivity is determined
%           by your overburden model. Choosing the default will usually mean your reflectivity
%           starts too early because the surface velocity is generally much slower that the first
%           logged velocity. A good choice for vsurf is 6000 ft/sec or 1800 m/sec (the speed of
%           sound in consolidated soil). Your overburden will then have a traveltime defined by the
%           described linear gradient. Suppose z1 is the first logged depth and v1 is the average
%           velocity at the top of the log. Then the time to the first reflectivty is
%           2*Z1*ln(v1/v0)/(v1-v0) where ln is natural log. If you want your reflectivity to start
%           at time zero, then shift the log depths to start at zero.
% ************ default = average at log top so the overburden is constant velocity ************
% fmult ... multiple flag. 
%            0 -> produce a primaries only convolutional seismogram
%            1 -> produce a primaries (with attenuation losses) plus multiples seismogram
%           Users should be aware that the computed multiple content is highly
%           sensitive to this time-blocking of the logs. This is not so true of the primaries. The
%           time blocking is determined by the time sample rate of the wavlet. Therefore running a
%           series of tests with ever smaller wavelet sample rate will show this effect. If very
%           accurate multiples are desired, choose a wavelet sample rate ten times smaller than
%           needed and resample afterwards. Note also that the multiple train is terminated by tmax.
%           Making tmax larger always shows more multiples.
% ************ default fmult=0 ************
% fpress ... flag for a pressure or displacement seismogram.
%            1 -> a pressure seismogram is desired
%            0 -> a displacement seismogram is desired
%           For a pressure seismogram, the source is a unit compression. For a displacement
%           seismogram, the source is a unit displacement in the positive z (down) direction.
% ************ default fpress = 0 ************ 
% tmax ... maximum time for the ouput seismogram. When fmult=1, then choosing tmax larger shows more
%          multiples. When fmult=0, a larger tmax just gives a larger zero pad.
% ********** default: time length of sonic + time overburden + length of wavelet ********
% 
% s ... final seismogram, includes zero pads for overburden and for tmax
% t ... time coordinate for s (and rcs, pm, and p)
% rcs ... normal incidence rcs, same length as s.
% NOTE: It is possible to see the effects of the constant time-thickness blocking from the rcs. 
%   To do this, Let dt=tw(2)-tw(1) and then:
%   v=10^6 ./sonic;%velocity from the sonic
%   imp=v.*rho; %impedance from logs
%   tz(2:length(impz))=2*cumsum(diff(z)./v(1:end-1));%traveltime coordinate from logs

%   ind=find(rcs~=0);%find where rcs are non zero to indicate log top
%   impt=rcs2imp1(rcs(ind(1):end),imp0);%convert rcs to time, note the use of imp0. 
%                                       %rcs2imp1 is in the CREWES inversion tools

%   legend('exact (log)',['new seismo I_0= ' num2str(imp0,5)])
%   prepfig
% pm ... attenuated primaries plus multiples, same length as s. If fmult == 0, this is identical to rcs.
% p ... attenuated primary rcs, same length as s. If fmult==0, this is identical to rcs. If fmult==1,
%       then the multiple content can be obtained as: pm-p . The primaries are called "attenuated"
%       because they have transmission losses applied. Transmission losses are not applied when
%       fmult=0.
