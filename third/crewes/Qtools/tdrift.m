% TDRIFT: calculate the drift time
%
% [tdr,t0,t1]=tdrift(Q,z,v0,f1,f0)
%
% Sonic logging is done at roughly f0=12500Hz while seismic data typically
% has a dominant frequency (called f1) below 50 Hz. Theory predicts that
% the velocities measured by the sonic tool will be systematically faster
% than those experienced by seismic waves. This frequency dependent
% velocity effect is the "dispersion" associated with Q attenuation. The
% drift time is the traveltime difference using the velocities at f0
% compared to f1. The formula used here is based on the Aki-Richards
% equation (5.81)
% v(f1)=v(f0)*(1+(1/(pi*Q))*log(f0/f1);
% which prescibes the variation of velocity with frequency for a constant Q
% medium. If t0 are the traveltimes at f0 and t1 are the traveltimes at f1,
% then the drift time is tdr=t0-t1. This will be positive if f0>f1.
%
% Q ... Q value (either a scalar or a vector the same size as z)
% z ... distance traveled (may be a vector such as from a well)
% v0 ... velocity measured by logging tool at frequency f0 (vector the same
%           size as z)
% f1 ... frequency of interest (a scalar, this should be the dominant
%           frequency of your seismic data) 
% f0 ... logging frequency (typically f1<<f0)
%   ********* default f0=12500 Hz ***********
% 
% tdr ... vector of drift times the same size as z
% t0 ... vector of traveltimes to each depth at frequency f0
% t1 ... vector of traveltimes to each depth at frequency f1
% Note: tdr is a one-way drift time. For application to surface reflection
% data this should be doubled.
