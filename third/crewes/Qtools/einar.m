%EINAR: generate a constant Q impulse response
%
% [quimp,tq]=einar(Q,x,vnot,dt,tmax,flag,frac_shift)
%
% Generate a constant Q impulse response. Based on Einar Kjartanssen's
% paper: Kjartansson, E., 1979, Constant Q-wave propagation and attenuation: 
%        Journal of Geophysical Research, 84, 4737-4748.
%
% Q ... Q
% x ... distance traveled
% vnot ... high frequency phase velocity
% dt ... time sample rate
% tmax ... maximum time output
% flag ... 0 means the wavlet is time shifted to the origin
%          1 means the wavelet is time delayed according to the propagation
%           distance
%   ************** default 1 ************
% frac_shift ... a number between 0 and 1 that is used only when flag=0.
%       frac_shift=1 removed the full timme delay at computed at vnot while
%       frac_shift=.9 removes only 90% of the delay.
%   ************** default = .95 **********
% fnot ... reference frequency at which vnot is specified.
%   ************** default = .5/dt (Nyquist) *************
%
% quimp ... impulse response (in retarded time or real time... see flag)
% tq ... time vector for quimp
