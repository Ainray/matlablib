% [Qave,tqa]=qint2qave(Qint,tq)
% 
% Qint ... vector of interval Q's
% tq    ... vector of times whose length is 1 greater than the length of Qint
% NOTE: Qint(k) is the Q for the interval tq(k)->tq(k+1). This is why tq
%   must be one sample longer than Qint.
% 
% Qave ... vector of average Q's the same length at Qint. Qave(k) is the
%       average Q from t(1) to t(k+1). Qave(1) is identical to Qint(1).
%       This means the Qave correspond to times tq(2:end)
% tqa ... provided for convenience. This is just tq(2:end)
%
% Average Q from t1 to t3 is defined as the Q value needed in a single
% layer of time thickness t3-t1 to get the same attenuation as n interval
% Q's arrayed between t1 and t3 at times between t1 and t3. This if
% Qint=[Q1 Q2] and tq=[t1 t2 t3], then Qave=[Qa1 Qa2 Qa3] where Qa1=Qa2=Q1,
% and (t3-t0)/Qa3=(t2-t1)/Q1+(t3-t2)/Q2.
