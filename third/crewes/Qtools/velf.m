function vf=velf(v,Q,f,f0)
%VELF: compute frequency-dependent phase velocity due to Q.
%
% vf=velf(v,Q,f,f0)
%
% Constant Q theory predicts that Q causes velocity to vary with frequency such that
% higher frequencies have facter velocities. Here we compute the this
% effect. Correction is done with the Azimi formula (see Aki and Richards
% chapter 5) which is vf=v*((1-(1./(pi*Q))*log(f/f0))).^(-1). Here vf is
% the corrected velocity for frequency f and v is the velocity measured at
% the reference frequency f0.
% 
% v ... vector of velocities
% Q ... either a scalar or a vector the same size as v
% f ... vector of frequencies to compute velocity at
% f0 ... reference frequency. This is the frequency at which v was
%        measured. If v is from well logging, then choose 12500 unless you
%        know the actual value for the sonic tool employed.
% *********** default 12500 Hz ************
%
% vf ... a length(v)-by-length(f) matrix of frequency-dependent velocities
