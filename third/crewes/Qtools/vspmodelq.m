% VSPMODELQ: creates a 1D synthetic VSP with Q
%
% [vsp,t,up,down]=vspmodelq(vp,rho,Q,z,w,tw,tmax,zr,f0,rflag,fpress)
%
% The algorithm is essentially that of Ganley (1981) with adaptations
% described in recent (2013,2014) CREWES reports by Margrave. The method
% uses 1-D visco-acoustic layer (e.g. propagator) matrices to compute a synthetic
% VSP. The input requires equal length vectors specifying velocity,
% density, Q, and the depths to layer boundaries. Velocities are assumed
% specified at the frequency f0 and are adjusted using the Azimi dispersion
% law (see Aki and Richards) to the frequences relevant to the model at
% hand. There can be any number of layers and input parameters can be
% prescribed directly from logs (use BLOCKLOGS if blocking is desired and
% Q can be deduced from the logs using FAKEQ). Model parameters must be
% specified from z=0 so most well logs will require that an overburden be
% attached (BLOCKLOGS can do this). Options exist to compute either a
% pressure or a displacement solution and to turn multiples on and off.
% Frequency dependent reflectivities (as required by Q theory) can also be
% turned on and off. The solution is a very high fidelity one that
% accurately models effects over a broad frequency range. It is a 1D solution so
% there is no spreading. However, transmission and attenuation losses are
% precisely computed.  For non-zero source depth use VSPMODELQS (CREWES
% sponsors only).
%
% vp ... p-wave velocity in each layer
% rho ... density in each layer
% Q  ... Q value in each layer
% z ... depths to layer tops (need not be regular)
% **** Requirement: z(1) must be 0 and length(z)=length(vp)=length(rho)=length(Q)
% w ... wavelet (can be causal or noncausal)
% tw ... time coordinate for wavelet
% tmax ... maximum record time
% zr ... vector of desired receiver depths (in increasing order)
% **** Requirement: all zr must lie between z(1) and z(end) *****
% f0 ... frequency at which vp has been measured.
% ********* default = 12500 Hz ************
%  The default is appropriate for well log velocities

% ********* default = 0 **********
% fpress ... 0 means a displacement seismogram
%            1 means a pressure seismogram
% ********* default = 0 ***********
% fmult ... 0 means primaries only, no internal multiples but still a surface multiple
%       ... 1 means all multiples
%       ... -1 means no internal multiples and no surface multiples
%       ... 2 means internal multiples but no surface multiples
%       ... 3 means no multiples and no transmission loss
%       ... 4 means all multiples but no transmission loss
% ********* default = 1 ***********
%
% vsp ... vsp wavefield
