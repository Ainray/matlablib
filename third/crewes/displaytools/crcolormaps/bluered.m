function a=bluered(m)
%BLUERED Dark Blue-White-Red
%   BLUERED(M) returns an M-by-3 matrix containing the colormap.
%   BLUERED, by itself, is the same length as the current figure's
%   colormap. If no figure exists, MATLAB creates one.
%
%   For example, to reset the colormap of the current figure:
%
%             colormap(BLUERED)
%
%   Modelled after Matlab's COPPER colormap.
