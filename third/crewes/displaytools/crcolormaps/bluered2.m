function a=bluered2(m)
%BLUERED2 Blue-Light Blue; Gold-Red
%   BLUERED2(M) returns an M-by-3 matrix containing a two-part colormap.
%   BLUERED2, by itself, is the same length as the current figure's
%   colormap. If no figure exists, MATLAB creates one.
%
%   For example, to reset the colormap of the current figure:
%
%             colormap(BLUERED2)
