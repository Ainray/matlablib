%
% PLOTIMAGE can be opened in several ways.  Simply typing 'plotimage' will
% initiate the PLOTIMAGE figure.  Initializing PLOTIMAGE using the other 
% methods does a quick plot of a seismic matrix in a figure window
% (made by plotimage). By default, it plots the seismic matrix in gray levels
% using the seisclrs colormap.  
%
%	smat ... the seismic matrix to be plotted. Traces are assumed stored in
%       the columns smat.
%	t ... time coordinates of traces.
%       ****** default 1:nrows where nrows = number of rows in smat ****
%	x ... x coordinates of the traces
%       ****** default 1:ncols where ncols=number of columns *****
%
% As of 2003, PLOTIMAGE has a new look interface and more features.
% Descriptions of new features follow.
% 
% Image Controls
%----------------
% There are three modes for which PLOTIMAGE can be set.  Zoom mode allows
% for the user to zoom in on the image using a box and zoom out with a
% single click.  There are two picking modes, Pick(O) and Pick(N).  The 'O'
% and 'N' stand for old and new.  This signifies that invoking Picks(O)
% allows user to augment an already existing pickset while
% invoking Picks(N) begins a new pickset by clearing the existing PICKS
% matrix and deleting any picks drawn on top of the plot.
%
% Each PLOTIMAGE window can also be set to the status of "independent",
% "master", or "slave".  This refers to the method by which the maximum
% absolute value and standard deviations of the data are obtained.  For
% both "independent" and "master" these numbers are measured from the input
% data while for the "slave" case the numbers are the same as for the most
% recent PLOTIMAGE window to be declared "master".  This allows multiple
% PLOTIMAGE windows to be displayed in true relative amplitude with respect
% to one another by setting one to be "master" and the other(s) to be
% "slave". NOTE: If you change the identity of the master window, then any
% slave windows are not automatically refreshed. To refresh then, simply
% toggle the amplitude control to independent and then back to slave.
% 
% The two basic plot modes, mean and maximum scaling, are described below. Mean scaling is
% best for real data (with a large dynamic range) while maximum scaling is preferred for
% synthetic data when you want an accurate display of amplitudes.
%
% Mean scaling (SCALE_OPT=1)... The mean and standard deviation of all samples are computed.
%		samples>= mean+CLIP*stddev are clipped (set equal to mean+CLIP*stddev).
%		(The same is done for negative samples which are set to mean -CLIP*stddev).
%		These two extremes are mapped to the ends of the color map and all
%		intermediate values are displayed linearly.
% Maximum scaling (SCALE_OPT=2) ... The maximum absolute value of the data is computed (say mxs).
%		The extremes of the colormap are then assigned to +/- mxs and all
%		intermediate values are displayed linearly. There is no clipping but
%       the display may be dominated by large values.
%
% MAIN AXIS 
% ---------
% Contains the image that the user has loaded.  Various uicontext menu
% controls (accessed using MB2 on the axis) help control the axis labels,
% sample rate, Zoom Options, and Picks options (only when other PLOTIMAGE
% figures are open).  
%
% Limit Box
%-----------
% Can be activated on the main axis uicontext menu, or Options menu.
% Activiating this function creates a box which finds the mean value inside
% the box and limits the rest of the image.  This can be used in both Mean
% amd Maximum scaling modes.  
%
% Zoom options
%--------------
% When zooming mode is initiated in the Image Controls, MB2 clicks and drags
% in the main axis will initiate zooming limited to the image.  When
% multiple PLOTIMAGES are open, each figure can be zoom locked to any
% other.  Publishing and Matching zoom limits are also available options
% when multiple PLOTIMAGE windows have been opened.
%
% Picking
%---------------
% There are two distinct types of picking: time-dips or amplitude.
% Picking of time-dips is done without reference to the data. The accuracy
% of the time-dip is entirely controlled by the user mouse motions. 
% In contrast, picking of amplitudes does refer to the data. The user
% clicks at distinct points to define a trajectory along which picks are to
% be
% made. This trajectory is then sent to PICKER to make the picks. It is also
% possible to copy PICKS from one PLOTIMAGE window to another. See the
% "options" menu. For more description on the mechanics of amplitude
% picking, type "help ipick". For more discussion on the picking algorithms
% type "help picker".
% 
% Global Pick Buffers
% Time-dip picks are stored in a global buffer called PICKS. Amplitude
% picks are stored in a global buffer called AMP_PICKS. Because these are
% global buffers, they are used by all open PLOTIMAGE windows. Things can
% get quite confusing so it is a good idea to pick in a single window at a
% time and harvest the picks from the buffers before moving on. NOTE: In
% Matlab, global variables are only visible (or accesible) if you declare
% them. That is done with commands like:
% >> global PICKS
% or 
% >> global AMP_PICKS
% 
% Structure of the PICKS global:
% This is an Nx3 cell matrix with one row for each PLOTIMAGE window. The
% columns of the kth row have the following contents:
% PICKS{k,1} ... the figure number of the PLOTIMAGE window that made the
%           picks
% PICKS{k,2} ... a matrix of real numbers defining the picks. There is one
%          row per pick. Each row has four entries defining the (x,t)
%          coordinates of the two points defining the time dip.
% PICKS{k,3} ... vector of the graphic handles of the picks.
%
% Structure of the AMP_PICKS global:
% This is a cell array of structures, one structure per picked event. Thus
% the structure for the kth picked event is accessed by:
% >> pickstruc=AMP_PICKS{k}
% The structures have the following fields:
% pickstruc.eventname ... the name of the event as specfied by the user
% pickstruc.handle ... the graphic handle of the line displaying the picks
% pickstruc.picktype ... string defining the type of pick (see PICKER for more)
% pickstruc.trajhandle ... graphic handle of the points clicked by the user to
%          define the picking trajectory.
% pickstruc.delt ... width of the picking fairway
% pickstruc.amppick ... amplitude of the pick
% pickstruc.ampevent ... amplitude of the event
% pickstruc.tpick ... time of the pick
% pickstruc.xpick ... x coordinate of the pick
% 
%
% Position Axis
% -------------
% This axis is a smaller version of the main axis.  When a zoom occures on
% the main axes, a red patch appears on the position axis that corresponds
% to the location of the zoom that just occured.  Moving the patch with MB1
% will also move the zoom parameters on the main axis.
%
% NOTE: PLOTIMAGE has a number of parameters that can be set via global
% variables.  SCALE_OPT, NUMBER_OF_COLORS, GRAY_PCT, CLIP, COLOR_MAP, AMPFLAG
% NOBRIGHTEN, PICKCOLOR, XAXISSTOP, CLOSEREQUEST, IMCONTROLS are all 
% parameters that the User is allowed to set in the command window while 
% plotimage is running.  These variables are best changed using the 
% figure context menu, but can also be changed by other programs while 
% plotimage is running.  Changing the corresponding globals sets the default 
% behavior, see plotimage_setglobal for more details.
% Meaning of Plotimage globals
%    CHECK_GLOBAL ... set to 1 to turn on the behavior of the other globals
%    SCALE_OPT ... controls the scaling option as described above
%    CLIP ... clip level (default 4)
%    AMPFLAG ... controls the relative scaling (independent, master, or slave)
%    NUMBER_OF_COLORS ... number of colors in the colormap (default 64)
%    GRAY_PCT ... controls the nonlinearity of the default gray scale
%    COLOR_MAP ... name of the colormap to use (default 'seisclrs')
%    NOBRIGHTEN ... determines brightness of the colormap
%    PICKCOLOR ... color of picks
%    XAXISTOP ... location of x axis (default 'bottom')
%    CLOSEREQUEST ... control whether plotimage closes with a warning or not
%    IMCONTROLS ... allows plotimage to begin with image controls hidden
% Again, for a better description of these, see plotimage_setglobal
% Note: You can set your favorite values for these easily in your startup.m
% file. For example, suppose you want plotimage to always begin with mean
% scaling and clip level of 6. Then the lines:
% global SCALE_OPT CLIP CHECK_GLOBAL
% SCALE_OPT=1;CLIP=6;CHECK_GLOBAL=1;
% could be placed in your startup.m file.
