%PLOTLOGS: Plot a section of logs as wiggles
%
% h=plotlogs(logsection,z,x,dname,haxe,xcur)
%
% Used to plot a cross section of similar logs as wiggles. The x-range of the logs is divided into a
% number of equal width "bins", one per log. Each log is then plotted in this bin and the maximum
% excursion of a log trace is given by the parameter xcur times the bin width. So xcur=1 means
% logs will never overplot each other but there may be lots of empty space. xcur=2 means a given log
% may actually plot on top of its neighbors but that is usually rare and the empty space is better
% filled. There is no way to tell from this plot what the numerical values of the logs are. You can
% judge their sililarity and observed trends. In this way it is much like a seismic section plot.
%
% logsection ... the section of logs as a matrix, one log per column. All logs must be the same
%       length and type.
% z ... depth (or time) coordinate for the logs. The length(z) must equal size(logsection,1).
% x ... distance coordinate for the log position. The length(x) must equal size(logsection,2).
% dname ...  dataset name used to title the plot
%  *********** default = '' ****************
% haxe ... handle of axes to plot in.
%  *********** default is to open a new figure and create a new axes (nan gets default) **********
% xcur ... maximum trace excursion expressed as a multiple of the box width.
%  *********** default = 2 ****************
% 
% h = array of handles of the plotted logs, one per log.
