function eventraymod(fignoz,fignot,pts,clr)
% EVENTRAYMOD: raytrace model a picked event assuming normal incidence
%
% eventraymod(fignoz,fignot,pts,clr)
%
% EVENTRAYMOD uses a velocity model initialized by RAYVELMOD and a
% vector of points picked using the picking facility in PLOTIMAGE.
% For each pair of npoints, a normal incidence ray is determined 
% and traced from the picked point to the surface. The traveltime is
% determined and plotted (2-way) in the figure indicated.
%
% fignoz ... figure number or handle to get the depth (dip) picks from
% fignot ... figure number or handle to plot the times in
% pts ... n x 2 matrix of (x,t) vaues from plotimage or equivalent
% ********** default is to use the global PICKS ***************
% ********** a value of nan for pts will invoke the default *************
% clr ... color to plot rays with
