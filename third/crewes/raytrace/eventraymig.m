% EVENTRAYMIG: raytrace migrate a picked event assuming normal incidence
%
% eventraymig(figno1,figno2,pts,clr)
%
% EVENTRAYMIG uses a velocity model initialized by RAYVELMOD and a
% set of events picked either using plotimage and automatically harvested from
% a plotimage figure or picked using GINPUT and passed in as an argument. 
% For each pick, a normal incidence ray is determined and projected down 
% into the velocity model.
%
% figno1 ... figure handle to take picks from
% figno2 ... figure handle to plot the rays in
% pts ... n x 2 matrix of (x,t) vaues from ginput or equivalent
% ********** default is to use the global PICKS ***************
% ********** a value of nan for pts will invoke the default *************
% clr ... color to plot rays with
