<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This software is intended to accompany the textbook "Numerical Methods of Exploration Seismology with algorithms in Matlab"
(NMES) by Gary F. Margrave.  The textbook and software release are part of an ongoing project to
upgrade the CREWES Matlab software library for use in teaching exploration seismology.
The CREWES Matlab library is a very large collection of geophysical routines that has grown
by accretion with very little regulation.  The software here is a subset of the CREWES library
in which each module has been checked for consistency and accuracy.  (However, no warranty of
correctness is given or implied. Use the software entirely at your own risk.)  As the topics
in NMES are expanded, more algorithms will be upgraded and transferred from the old CREWES
library to this new one.  Eventually, the entire CREWES Matlab library will be included
here and described in the book.</p>

<h2>Updates</h2>
<p>Updates are frequent. You may obtain recent updates at the CREWES website:</p>
