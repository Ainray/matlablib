function [dump,words,inotempty]=traceheaderdump(trchdr,iwrite)
% TRACEHEADERDUMP: does a complete dump of the SEGY trace headers from a SegyFile object
%
% [dump,words,inotempty]=traceheaderdump(trchdr,iwrite);
%      or
% traceheaderdump(trchdr);
%
% TRACEHEADERDUMP examines all fields in the traceheader structure and prints on the screen the names
% of those fields that are not empty and their SEGY word number. There are currently 91 possible words
% in the SEGY trace header according to SEGY Rev 1. Because these are the trace headers, each word has
% a possibly unique value for each trace; however, it is often true that these values are either
% constant or zero. Usually, trace header words that are entirely zero are not useful. This function
% makes it easy to find the non-zero entries.
%
% trchdr ... the trace header structure read by a SegyFile object.
% iwrite ... 1 means write to the command window the names of non-empty header words. 0 means don't
%           write.
% ************* default =1 ************
% dump ... nwords by ntraces array of header values. nwords is the number
%   of defined header words that can be stored in a trace header according to SEGY Rev 1.  Currently
%   nwords=91.
% words ... cell array of all 91 defined header words
% inotempty ... vector of indices into words of the non-empty parts of the trace headers
% 
% To see a list of header words that are non-empty and hence can be useful, do:
%
% sf=SegyFile([path,fname],'r'); %create a SegyFile object, open for read.
% [trchdr,trcdat]=sf.Trc.read; %read all trace headers and trace data
% [dump,words,inotempty]=traceheaderdump(trchdr); %dump the trace headers
% words(inotempty) %note round brackets
%
% The last line here is not really necessary since traceheaderdump nows prints this information on
% the screen.
%
% You may wish to use traceheaderdump_g to see graphically what is in each nonzero header. 
%
% To retrieve the kth header value, if you ran traceheaderdump with returns, use:
% value = dump(k,:);
%
% Or if you ran it without returns use:
% value=double(getfield(trchdr,words{(k)}));
% note carefully the round and curly brackets in this statement. k must be
% an integer between 1 and length(inotempty). If you omit the double command then the header value
% will likely be of class int32.
