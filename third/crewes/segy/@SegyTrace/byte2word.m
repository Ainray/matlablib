% BYTE2WORD returns the header word nearest a byte location in traceheaders
%
% fn=byte2word(byteloc)
%
% byteloc ... a SEGY byte location. Must be between 1 and NumExtTrcHdrs * 240. 
% fn      ... the name of the SEGY header word in obj.HdrDef whose starting 
%             byte location is nearest to byteloc
% bl      ... actual byte location for fn
% idx     ... corresponting number in header definition
%
% Example, retrieve the SEGY header value stored at byte location 17
% [fn,bl,idx] = byte2word(17)
