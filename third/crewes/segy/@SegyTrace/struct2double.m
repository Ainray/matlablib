function [d,f,t] = struct2double(s)
%Converts a trace header struct to an array of doubles
%
% function [d,f,t] = struct2double(s)
% Where:
%     s = struct such as produced by Trace/read for the trace headers
%     d = all values stored in s as a 2D matrix of doubles
%     f = all fieldnames in s as a cell array
%     t = cell array of datatypes (eg. int8, uint16, etc.)
