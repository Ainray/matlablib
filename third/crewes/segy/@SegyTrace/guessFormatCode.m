function obj = guessFormatCode(obj)
%Guess if trace data are IBM32 or IEEE32 for FormatCode=1
%
% function fc = guessFormatCode(obj)
%
% Algorithm: If SEG-Y FormatCode = 1 read the ten random traces from the file as
% uint32, then use ibm2double and double2ibm to convert IEEE and back to 
% uint32. If the result does not match the input then trace data may 
% actually be IEEE floating point, or FormatCode = 5. This is typically an
% issue seen with SEG-Y revision 0 files, before FormatCode = 5 became part
% of the SEG-Y standard in revision 1.
