Introduction: This library is a simple deconvolution toolkit. Deconvolution can be classified
            : into two catagories, deterministic and blind. We concentrate on deterministic
			: deconvolution. That is, in the LSI model: x(t)*h(t)=y(t), we both know the
			: input and output to  solving the impulse response. Or equivalently, we know 
            : the impulse response and the output, evaluating the input.
